# PM Assistant – Region Admin Guide

This guide is for **region administrators** and **admins** who manage **region content**, **notices**, and **projects** for a specific region.

---

## Accessing the Region Admin Dashboard

1. **Sign in** with a **region_admin** or **admin** account.
2. On the **Dashboard**, click **Manage Region** (or go to **/region/admin**).
3. The **Region Admin Dashboard** opens. You must have a **region** assigned (or, for admins, a selected region).

If you see **Access Denied**, you don’t have permission. Contact your administrator.

## Managing region content

The dashboard lists **content sections** for your region, for example:

- **About the Region** – General information
- **Contact Information** – Phone, email, address, office hours
- **Services Offered** – Services available to citizens
- **Statistics & Demographics** – Population and key metrics
- **Location & Map** – Geographic information
- **Demographics**, **History**, **Leadership** – Optional sections

### Editing or creating a section

1. On the Region Admin Dashboard, find the section (e.g. **About the Region**).
2. Click **Edit** or **Create**.
3. You’ll go to the **Section Editor** for that section type.
4. Fill in:
   - **Title**
   - **Content** (rich text / plain text, depending on setup)
   - **Display order** (optional)
   - **Visible** – Turn on to show on the public region page, off to hide.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Use **Preview** (if available) to see how it looks on the public region page.

Only **visible** sections appear on the public **Region Info** page.

## Managing notices

1. In the app menu or dashboard, open **Manage Notices** (or go to **/region/notices**).
2. You’ll see a list of **notices** for your region (published and draft).
3. **Create notice** – Click **Create Notice**, then enter:
   - **Title**
   - **Content**
   - **Category** (e.g. General, Project update, Emergency)
   - **Priority** (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
   - **Expires at** (optional)
4. **Publish** – Use **Publish** so the notice appears on the public region page. **Unpublish** to hide it.
5. **Edit** or **Delete** – Use the actions on each notice.

Only **published** notices are shown to citizens. **Expired** notices are hidden automatically.

---

## Managing projects (region)

- From the Region Admin Dashboard you can typically **link to projects** in your region or **manage** them, depending on configuration.
- Use **Manage Projects** (or the project list) to see region projects, add new ones, or update status.
- Project details (name, status, dates, etc.) are managed like in the main [User Guide](./USER_GUIDE.md).

---

## Previewing the public region page

1. On the Region Admin Dashboard, click **Preview Public Page**.
2. You’ll see the **Region Info** page as citizens see it: **Overview** (content sections), **Notices**, and **Project status**.
3. Use this to check that sections and notices look correct before publishing.

---

## Tips

- **Visibility** – Toggle **Visible** on sections you want on the public page; hide others to keep them draft.
- **Notices** – Use **Publish** only when ready; **Unpublish** to correct or retire a notice.
- **Save** – Always save after editing a section or notice.
- **Preview** – Preview regularly to ensure the public page stays accurate.
