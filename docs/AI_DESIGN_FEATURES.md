# AI Design Features - PM Assistant

**Last updated:** February 28, 2026
**LLM Provider:** Claude API (Anthropic SDK)
**Architecture:** Fastify + TypeScript backend, React frontend, MySQL database
**AI Kill Switch:** `AI_ENABLED` environment variable disables all AI features globally

---

## Overview

PM Assistant embeds AI across the entire project management lifecycle. Every AI capability is powered by the Anthropic Claude SDK, with structured JSON output validated by Zod schemas. All features degrade gracefully when AI is unavailable -- the application remains fully functional without AI.

Key architectural components:
- **Claude Service** (`claudeService.ts`) -- Core SDK integration with streaming, JSON schema mode, tool use, rate limiting, retry logic, and token tracking
- **AI Context Builder** (`aiContextBuilder.ts`) -- Assembles rich project/portfolio context for every AI call from database records
- **AI Action Executor** (`aiActionExecutor.ts`) -- Executes AI-recommended mutations (create/update tasks, projects) with policy-engine gating and audit logging
- **AI Tool Definitions** (`aiToolDefinitions.ts`) -- Claude tool schemas for agentic tool-use in chat
- **AI Usage Logger** (`aiUsageLogger.ts`) -- Tracks every AI request: tokens, cost, latency, success/failure
- **Prompt Templates** -- Versioned `PromptTemplate` class with variable interpolation; all prompts are version-controlled, not hardcoded strings
- **Agent Scheduler** (`AgentSchedulerService.ts`) -- Cron-based background AI analysis across all active projects
- **MCP Server** (`mcp-server/`) -- Model Context Protocol server exposing 15+ tool categories to Claude Desktop and Claude Web

## 1. AI Chat

**Service:** `AIChatService` (`aiChatService.ts`)
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/ai/chat` (streaming via SSE)

A persistent, context-aware conversational assistant available throughout the application.

**Capabilities:**
- Streaming responses delivered via Server-Sent Events (typewriter effect)
- Context-aware: knows which page and project the user is viewing (`dashboard`, `project`, `schedule`, `reports`, `general`)
- Agentic tool use: Claude can call tools to create tasks, update projects, assign resources, and more -- all gated by the policy engine
- Conversation history maintained per user with database persistence
- Action results embedded in responses (e.g., "I created task X" with confirmation)
- Conversation continues across page navigation

**Tool-use flow:**
1. User sends a message with optional context (project ID, page type)
2. AIChatService builds project context via AIContextBuilder
3. Claude receives the message with tool definitions from `aiToolDefinitions.ts`
4. If Claude invokes a tool, AIActionExecutor runs the action with policy checks and audit logging
5. Results stream back to the client via SSE

  2. **Structuring phase:** A second Claude call formats the answer into structured JSON with markdown text, chart specifications, and follow-up suggestions

## Architecture: Supporting Infrastructure

### Claude Service (`claudeService.ts`)

The core integration layer for all AI features:

- Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) with configurable model, max tokens, and temperature
- **Completion modes:** standard text, JSON schema (structured output with Zod validation), streaming (SSE chunks), and tool-use (agentic loops)
- Versioned prompt templates with `{{variable}}` interpolation
- Rate limiting and retry with exponential backoff
- Request timeout (30s default)
- Token usage tracking with per-model cost calculation (supports Sonnet, Haiku, Opus pricing)
- Graceful degradation: `isAvailable()` check guards all AI features

**Configuration:**
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
AI_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
AI_MAX_TOKENS=4096
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.3
AI_ENABLED=true
```

### AI Context Builder (`aiContextBuilder.ts`)

Assembles rich context for every AI call:

- `buildProjectContext(projectId)` -- Pulls project metadata, schedules, tasks, team, budget into a `ProjectContext` object
- `buildPortfolioContext()` -- Aggregates all projects into a `PortfolioContext` for cross-project features
- `toPromptString(context)` -- Serializes context into a compact string for prompt injection
- Keeps token usage efficient by structuring data compactly

### AI Action Executor (`aiActionExecutor.ts`)

Executes AI-recommended mutations safely:

- Supports: `create_task`, `update_task`, `create_project`, `update_project`, and more
- Every action passes through the **policy engine** for role-based authorization
- Every action is recorded in the **audit ledger** for accountability
- Returns structured `ActionResult` with success/failure, summary, and data

### AI Usage Logger (`aiUsageLogger.ts`)

Tracks all AI API usage for cost monitoring:

- Logs: user, feature name, model, input/output tokens, cost estimate, latency, success/failure
- Per-model pricing tables (Sonnet, Haiku, Opus)
- Database-backed (`ai_usage_log` table)

### Agent Scheduler (`AgentSchedulerService.ts`)

Cron-based background AI analysis:

- **Daily scan** on configurable schedule (`AGENT_CRON_SCHEDULE`, default: 2 AM)
  - Scans all active projects for: delays (AutoRescheduleService), EVM forecasts, Monte Carlo simulations
  - Generates notifications and webhook events for detected issues
  - Logs all agent activity via `AgentActivityLogService`
- **Overdue-task scanner** runs every N minutes (`AGENT_OVERDUE_SCAN_MINUTES`, default: 15)
  - Detects tasks where `end_date < NOW()` and status is not completed/cancelled
  - Fires `date_passed` workflow triggers via `dagWorkflowService.evaluateTaskChange()`
  - Deduplicates to avoid re-triggering for the same task
- Controlled by `AGENT_ENABLED` environment variable

### Event-Driven Workflow Integration

Task and project lifecycle events automatically trigger DAG workflows:

- `ScheduleService.createTask()` and `updateTask()` call `dagWorkflowService.evaluateTaskChange()` (fire-and-forget)
- `ProjectService.update()` calls `dagWorkflowService.evaluateProjectChange()` on budget or status changes
- Trigger types: `task_created`, `status_change`, `priority_change`, `assignment_change`, `dependency_change`, `budget_threshold`, `project_status_change`, `date_passed`, `progress_threshold`, `manual`
- Actions include `send_notification` (creates real notifications), `invoke_agent` (calls registered agent capabilities), `update_field`, and `log_activity`

### MCP Server (`mcp-server/`)

Model Context Protocol server for Claude Desktop and Claude Web integration:

**11 tools** defined in `mcp-server/server.ts`:
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list-projects` | List all projects |
| `get-project` | Get project details by ID |
| `get-schedules` | Get all schedules for a project |
| `get-tasks` | Get all tasks in a schedule |
| `get-project-health` | AI health score for a project |
| `get-project-risks` | AI risk assessment for a project |
| `get-project-budget` | AI budget forecast for a project |
| `get-analytics` | Portfolio-level analytics summary |
| `get-alerts` | Proactive alerts across all projects |
| `search` | Search projects and tasks by keyword |
| `get-portfolio` | Full portfolio overview |

**Authentication:** API key (stdio transport); OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (HTTP transport)
**Transport:** stdio (MCP SDK); HTTP reverse proxy via `/mcp` route with OAuth 2.1 authorization server

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Graceful degradation:** All AI features check `claudeService.isAvailable()` before calling the API. When unavailable, fallback logic provides non-AI responses or the feature is skipped.
- **Cost control:** Every AI request is logged with token counts and cost estimates. Per-model pricing is tracked automatically.
- **Latency:** Interactive features target sub-5-second responses. Background agent tasks run asynchronously on cron schedules.
- **Audit trail:** Every AI interaction is logged (who asked, what context, what was returned). Mutating actions go through the policy engine and audit ledger.
- **Schema validation:** All AI outputs are validated against Zod schemas before being returned to clients, preventing malformed or hallucinated data from reaching the UI.
- **Prompt versioning:** All prompts use the `PromptTemplate` class with semantic version numbers.
- **Feature flags:** AI is globally controlled by `AI_ENABLED`; the agent scheduler by `AGENT_ENABLED`. Individual features degrade independently.
