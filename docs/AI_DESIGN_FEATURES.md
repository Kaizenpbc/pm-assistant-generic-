# AI Design Features - PM Assistant

**Last updated:** June 30, 2026
**LLM Provider:** Claude API (Anthropic SDK)
**Architecture:** Fastify + TypeScript backend, React frontend, MySQL database
**AI Kill Switch:** `AI_ENABLED` environment variable disables all AI features globally
**Agent Kill Switch:** `KillSwitchService` provides runtime API-controlled agent shutdown (global, per-agent, per-project) with audit trail — distinct from the env-var kill switch
**Agentic System:** 14 autonomous agents with 3-tier autonomy model (Notify → Propose → Auto-Execute)

---

## Overview

PM Assistant is an agentic AI-native project management platform. 14 specialized agents continuously monitor projects, detect issues, reason about solutions via Claude, and propose (or autonomously execute) corrective actions — all governed by confidence scoring, risk classification, and human-in-the-loop controls. Every AI capability is powered by the Anthropic Claude SDK, with structured JSON output validated by Zod schemas. All features degrade gracefully when AI is unavailable -- the application remains fully functional without AI.

Key architectural components:
- **Claude Service** (`claudeService.ts`) -- Core SDK integration with streaming, JSON schema mode, tool use, rate limiting, retry logic, and token tracking
- **AI Context Builder** (`aiContextBuilder.ts`) -- Assembles rich project/portfolio context for every AI call from database records
- **AI Action Executor** (`aiActionExecutor.ts`) -- Executes AI-recommended mutations (create/update tasks, projects) with policy-engine gating and audit logging
- **AI Tool Definitions** (`aiToolDefinitions.ts`) -- Claude tool schemas for agentic tool-use in chat
- **AI Usage Logger** (`aiUsageLogger.ts`) -- Tracks every AI request: tokens, cost, latency, success/failure
- **Prompt Templates** -- Versioned `PromptTemplate` class with variable interpolation; all prompts are version-controlled, not hardcoded strings
- **Agent Scheduler** (`AgentSchedulerService.ts`) -- Cron-based background AI analysis across all active projects
- **Agentic Pipeline** (`services/agents/`) -- Autonomous reasoning, proposal creation, and controlled execution:
  - **ReasoningEngine** -- Assembles context, calls Claude with structured prompts, parses recovery/scope analysis plans
  - **ActionProposalService** -- Creates and manages proposals with lifecycle tracking (pending -> approved -> executed)
  - **ActionExecutor** -- Executes approved proposals step-by-step with rollback on failure
  - **ConfidenceCalculator** -- Weighted confidence scoring (data quality 40%, historical accuracy 30%, model certainty 30%)
  - **AgentCostTracker** -- Token usage tracking, budget enforcement, cost aggregation
  - **ConflictResolver** -- Detects stale proposals, prevents dual-agent conflicts, human-edit-wins rule
  - **ProposalRateLimiter** -- Per-agent/project rate limits (3/agent/24h, 10/all/24h, 10/agent/7d, 30/all/7d)
  - **DegradationHandler** -- Circuit breakers per agent, DB health monitoring, scan scope recommendation
  - **KillSwitchService** -- Global/per-agent/per-project emergency shutdown with audit logging
  - **AgentFeedbackService** -- Records proposal outcomes, feeds into historical accuracy scoring
- **MCP Server** (`mcp-server/`) -- Model Context Protocol server exposing 15+ tool categories to Claude Desktop and Claude Web

## 1. Mjuzi Chat

**Service:** `AIChatService` (`aiChatService.ts`)
**Repository:** `ChatRepository` (`database/ChatRepository.ts`)
**Endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/ai-chat/message` (non-streaming with tools), `POST /api/v1/ai-chat/stream` (SSE streaming)

Mjuzi is the persistent, context-aware conversational AI assistant available throughout the application.

**Capabilities:**
- Non-streaming mode with full agentic tool use, or streaming responses via Server-Sent Events (typewriter effect)
- Context-aware: knows which page and project the user is viewing (`dashboard`, `project`, `schedule`, `reports`, `general`)
- Agentic tool use: Claude can call tools to create tasks, update projects, assign resources, and more -- all gated by the policy engine
- **Database-backed persistence:** conversations and messages stored in `chat_conversations` and `chat_messages` tables via `ChatRepository`. Survives server restarts.
- **Agent memory integration:** injects `InterAgentQueryService` scan findings, prior conversation count, and Mjuzi's own project memories (`agentMemoryService.recall('mjuzi-chat', ...)`) into the system prompt
- **Action memory:** after tool use, stores a summary via `agentMemoryService.store()` for future reference
- Action results embedded in responses (e.g., "I created task X" with confirmation)
- Conversation history UI: browse, switch, and resume past conversations
- Conversation continues across page navigation and browser refreshes

**Tool-use flow:**
1. User sends a message with optional context (project ID, page type)
2. AIChatService builds project context via AIContextBuilder, enriched with agent insights and Mjuzi memories
3. Claude receives the message with tool definitions from `aiToolDefinitions.ts`
4. If Claude invokes a tool, AIActionExecutor runs the action with policy checks and audit logging
5. Response returned to client; conversation and messages persisted to database

---

## Architecture: Supporting Infrastructure

### Claude Service (`claudeService.ts`)

The core integration layer for all AI features:

- Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) with configurable model, max tokens, and temperature
- **Completion modes:** standard text, JSON schema (structured output with Zod validation), streaming (SSE chunks), and tool-use (agentic loops)
- Versioned prompt templates with `{{variable}}` interpolation
- Rate limiting and retry with exponential backoff
- Request timeout (30s default)
- Token usage tracking with per-model cost calculation (supports Sonnet, Haiku, Opus pricing)
- Per-tier budget enforcement: budget resolution chain (per-user override → tier default → global fallback + top-up tokens). Returns HTTP 429 with `AI_BUDGET_EXCEEDED` code when exhausted.
- Graceful degradation: `isAvailable()` check guards all AI features; budget exhaustion blocks AI but preserves all non-AI functionality

**Configuration:**
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
AI_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
AI_MAX_TOKENS=4096
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.3
AI_ENABLED=true
```

### AI Context Builder (`aiContextBuilder.ts`)

Assembles rich context for every AI call:

- `buildProjectContext(projectId)` -- Pulls project metadata, schedules, tasks, team, budget into a `ProjectContext` object
- `buildPortfolioContext()` -- Aggregates all projects into a `PortfolioContext` for cross-project features
- `toPromptString(context)` -- Serializes context into a compact string for prompt injection
- Keeps token usage efficient by structuring data compactly

### AI Action Executor (`aiActionExecutor.ts`)

Executes AI-recommended mutations safely:

- Supports: `create_task`, `update_task`, `create_project`, `update_project`, and more
- Every action passes through the **policy engine** for role-based authorization
- Every action is recorded in the **audit ledger** for accountability
- Returns structured `ActionResult` with success/failure, summary, and data

### AI Usage Logger (`aiUsageLogger.ts`)

Tracks all AI API usage for cost monitoring:

- Logs: user, feature name, model, input/output tokens, cost estimate, latency, success/failure
- Per-model pricing tables (Sonnet, Haiku, Opus)
- Database-backed (`ai_usage_log` table)

### Agent Scheduler (`AgentSchedulerService.ts`)

Cron-based background AI analysis:

- **Daily scan** on configurable schedule (`AGENT_CRON_SCHEDULE`, default: 2 AM)
  - Kill switch guard at top of scan — aborts if globally disabled
  - Scans all active projects through 5 agents:
    1. **Auto-Reschedule** — delay detection and proposal generation
    2. **Budget Burn-Rate** — CPI/SPI threshold monitoring
    3. **Monte Carlo Confidence** — schedule risk assessment
    4. **Meeting Follow-Up** — overdue action items and unapplied updates
    5. **Scope Creep Detection** — task growth, estimate increases, change requests vs baselines
  - Generates notifications and webhook events for detected issues
  - Logs all agent activity via `AgentActivityLogService`
- **Overdue-task scanner** runs every N minutes (`AGENT_OVERDUE_SCAN_MINUTES`, default: 15)
  - Detects tasks where `end_date < NOW()` and status is not completed/cancelled
  - Fires `date_passed` workflow triggers via `dagWorkflowService.evaluateTaskChange()`
  - Deduplicates to avoid re-triggering for the same task
- Controlled by `AGENT_ENABLED` environment variable and `KillSwitchService` runtime API

### Event-Driven Workflow Integration

Task and project lifecycle events automatically trigger DAG workflows:

- `ScheduleService.createTask()` and `updateTask()` call `dagWorkflowService.evaluateTaskChange()` (fire-and-forget)
- `ProjectService.update()` calls `dagWorkflowService.evaluateProjectChange()` on budget or status changes
- Trigger types: `task_created`, `status_change`, `priority_change`, `assignment_change`, `dependency_change`, `budget_threshold`, `project_status_change`, `date_passed`, `progress_threshold`, `manual`
- Actions include `send_notification` (creates real notifications), `invoke_agent` (calls registered agent capabilities), `update_field`, and `log_activity`

### MCP Server (`mcp-server/`)

Model Context Protocol server for Claude Desktop and Claude Web integration:

**11 tools** defined in `mcp-server/server.ts`:

### Predictive Alerting Agent (`PredictiveAlertingAgent.ts`)

- **Trigger:** Per-project scan cycle
- **Perception:** Analyzes velocity trend (recent 3-sprint avg vs historical), progress trajectory (completion % vs time elapsed %), risk accumulation (agent proposals in last 30 days), similar project comparison
- **Significance:** Velocity decline > 20% OR behind schedule > 15% OR >= 3 agent flags in 30 days
- **Reasoning:** Claude generates early warning with probability assessment
- **Output:** Predictive alert with recommended preventive actions
- **Risk level:** Dynamic (critical/high/medium based on severity)

### Autonomous Execution (Tier 3)

Agents with proven track records can be promoted from Tier 2 (propose-only) to Tier 3 (auto-execute):

- **Promotion criteria:** >= 30 days, >= 20 proposals, >= 80% acceptance, >= 70% effectiveness, zero rollbacks
- **Auto-execute gates:** Tier 3 AND confidence >= threshold (default 80) AND risk <= max level (default `low`)
- **Service:** `AutonomyService` (`src/server/services/agents/AutonomyService.ts`)
- **API:** `GET/PUT /api/v1/agent/autonomy/:agentId` (admin only)
- **Table:** `agent_autonomy_config`

### Proposal Lifecycle

```
Agent detects issue
  -> ReasoningEngine calls Claude with structured prompt
  -> ConfidenceCalculator scores result (data quality + historical accuracy + model certainty)
  -> If confidence >= 40%: ActionProposalService creates proposal (status: pending)
  -> User reviews proposal (approve / reject)
  -> If approved: ActionExecutor runs actions in order with rollback on failure
  -> User submits feedback (effective / ineffective / made worse)
  -> Feedback feeds into historical accuracy for future confidence scores
```

### Governance Controls

- **KillSwitchService:** In-memory global/agent/project kill switches. All changes audit-logged. Resets to enabled on restart (safe default). API: `POST /api/v1/agent/kill-switch`, `PUT /api/v1/agent/kill-switch/agent/:agentId`, `PUT /api/v1/agent/kill-switch/project/:projectId`
- **ProposalRateLimiter:** 4-tier rate limiting prevents alert fatigue. Queries `agent_proposals` table (no new tables needed).
- **DegradationHandler:** Circuit breakers open after 3 consecutive failures, retry after 1h then 24h. DB latency check via `SELECT 1`. Recommended scan scope: full/reduced/critical_only/none based on infrastructure health.
- **ConflictResolver:** Expires pending proposals when humans edit targeted entities. Prevents two agents from targeting the same entity in one scan. Batch staleness sweep.

### Agent Health Endpoint

`GET /api/v1/agent/health` returns combined status:
- Claude API availability
- Database health and latency
- Circuit breaker states per agent
- Kill switch state (global + disabled agents/projects)
- Recommended scan scope
- Daily cost tracking
- Pending proposal count

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Graceful degradation:** All AI features check `claudeService.isAvailable()` before calling the API. When unavailable, fallback logic provides non-AI responses or the feature is skipped.
- **Cost control:** Every AI request is logged with token counts and cost estimates. Per-model pricing is tracked automatically. Per-tier monthly token budgets (Free: 25K, Pro: 500K, Business: 1.5M, Consultant: 3M) are enforced before every AI call. Purchasable token top-ups ($5/500K) extend budgets on demand.
- **Latency:** Interactive features target sub-5-second responses. Background agent tasks run asynchronously on cron schedules.
- **Audit trail:** Every AI interaction is logged (who asked, what context, what was returned). Mutating actions go through the policy engine and audit ledger.
- **Schema validation:** All AI outputs are validated against Zod schemas before being returned to clients, preventing malformed or hallucinated data from reaching the UI.
- **Prompt versioning:** All prompts use the `PromptTemplate` class with semantic version numbers.
- **Feature flags:** AI is globally controlled by `AI_ENABLED`; the agent scheduler by `AGENT_ENABLED`; runtime agent control via `KillSwitchService` API (global/per-agent/per-project). Individual features degrade independently.
