## 2. Projects

### Creating a Project

1. From the Dashboard, click **Create New Project**.
2. Fill in the project details:
   - **Name** (required) -- A descriptive project name.
   - **Description** -- Overview of the project scope.
   - **Status** -- Planning, Active, On Hold, Completed, or Cancelled.
   - **Priority** -- Low, Medium, High, or Urgent.
   - **Budget Allocated** -- The total budget for the project.
   - **Start Date / End Date** -- Planned project timeline.
   - **Assigned PM** -- The project manager responsible.
3. Click **Create** to save the project.

### Editing a Project

Open a project from the Dashboard or Projects page. Edit any field (name, description, status, priority, budget, dates, assigned PM) and save your changes.

### Deleting a Project

From the project detail view, use the delete option. This action requires appropriate permissions and will remove the project and all associated schedules, tasks, and data.

### Project Detail View

The project detail page shows 5 context cards at the top: **Progress**, **Budget**, **Timeline**, **Risks** (open risk count with critical alert), and **Status**.

Tabs are organized into 7 primary tabs shown directly and 6 secondary tabs accessible via a **More** dropdown:

**Primary tabs:** Overview, Schedule, RAID, Sprints, Team, AI Insights, EVM Forecast

**More dropdown:** Change Requests, Resource Leveling, Network Diagram, Burndown, What-If, Agent Activity

The **Overview** tab includes:

- **Project Details** -- Metadata chips (priority, category, type, PM, dates, currency).
- **Team Members** -- Assigned members with role badges.
- **Task Summary** -- Total, completed, overdue, and in-progress task counts.
- **Timeline Progress** -- Elapsed vs complete percentage with on-track/behind/overdue indicator.
- **Key Milestones** -- Milestone list with status icons and dates.
- **RAID Summary** -- 2x2 grid showing open risks, open issues, open actions, and pending decisions with critical/triggered badges.
- **Current Sprint** -- Active sprint name, day progress (Day X of Y), task completion bar, and sprint goal.
- **Recent Activity** -- Last 6 audit trail entries with user, action, and timestamp.
- **Attachments** -- File uploads with version history.
- **Custom Fields** -- User-defined metadata fields.
- **Portal Links** -- External portal link management. Each link generates a unique token URL (`/portal/:token`) that stakeholders can access without logging in. The portal shows project progress, task statistics, budget summary, milestone timeline, recent activity, and a comment form. Visibility of each section is controlled by the link's permissions (`canViewBudget`, `canViewGantt`, `canViewReports`, `canComment`).
- **Export XML** -- Click the **Export XML** button (same row as Export CSV and Export PDF) to download the project as an MSPDI XML file. This format is compatible with Microsoft Project and ProjectLibre and includes tasks, resources, assignments, and dependency links.

#### Real-Time Presence

When other users are viewing the same project, their avatar circles appear in the project header next to the action buttons. Each circle shows the user's initials with a tooltip displaying their username. This helps teams coordinate and avoid conflicting edits.

---

## 3. Schedules and Tasks

### Creating a Schedule

1. Open a project and navigate to the **Schedule** tab.
2. Click **Create Schedule** or **New Schedule**.
3. Give the schedule a name and save.
4. You can have multiple schedules per project (e.g., baseline schedule, revised schedule).

### Adding Tasks

1. Within a schedule, click **Add Task**.
2. Fill in the task form:
   - **Name** (required) -- Task description.
   - **Status** -- Pending, In Progress, Completed, or Cancelled.
   - **Priority** -- Low, Medium, High, or Urgent.
   - **Start Date / End Date** -- Task timeline.
   - **Estimated Days** -- Duration estimate.
   - **Progress Percentage** -- Current completion (0-100%).
   - **Assigned To** -- Team member responsible.
   - **Description** -- Detailed task notes.
   - **Story Points** -- Agile estimation value.
   - **Recurrence** -- Set a recurring schedule (Daily, Weekly, Biweekly, or Monthly). For Weekly/Biweekly, select specific days. Recurring templates auto-generate task instances within a 14-day horizon.
3. Click **Save** to add the task.

### Task Hierarchy

Tasks can be organized hierarchically:

- Create **parent tasks** (phases or work packages) as top-level items.
- Add **subtasks** under parent tasks to break down work.
- Expand or collapse task groups using the chevron icon.

### Dependencies

Each task supports up to **20 predecessors**. Set dependencies to define execution order:

- **Adding predecessors** -- In the task form modal, use the multi-predecessor panel: click **Add Predecessor** to add a row, then choose the predecessor task, dependency type, and optional lag days. Use the remove button on any row to delete it.
- **Dependency Type** -- Each predecessor has its own type: Finish-to-Start (FS), Start-to-Start (SS), Finish-to-Finish (FF), or Start-to-Finish (SF). FS is the default.
- **Lag** -- Optional number of days on each individual dependency (e.g., a 2-day lag on FS means the successor starts 2 days after the predecessor finishes). Negative lag represents lead time.
- **In Table view** -- Click the Predecessor cell and type one or more entries separated by commas (e.g. `3`, `5SS`, `7FS+2d`, `3FS+2d,5SS,7`). Press Enter to save.
- Dependencies are displayed as a comma-separated list in compact MS Project row-number format. Each predecessor shows a health dot: green (done), yellow (in progress), red (overdue).
- Gantt dependency arrows are drawn for each predecessor and colour-coded by predecessor health. All predecessors are used in critical path and Monte Carlo analysis.
- **Validation** -- The server enforces dependency rules for each predecessor: no self-references, no circular dependencies (A→B→C→A), dependencies must exist and be in the same schedule, and the 20-predecessor limit is enforced. Invalid dependencies return an error message explaining the issue.
- **Orphan cleanup** -- Deleting a task automatically removes all dependency records that referenced it (via `ON DELETE CASCADE`), so no other tasks are left with broken predecessors.

### Task Activity Panel

Click on any task to view its activity history, including status changes, reassignments, date modifications, and comments.

**@Mentions in comments** -- When writing a comment, type `@` to open an autocomplete list of project members. Selecting a name inserts the mention. The mentioned user receives an in-app notification linking to that task.

### Delay Detection

Tasks that are behind schedule are flagged with a delay indicator showing the number of days overdue. The system automatically detects schedule slippage.

### Bulk Operations

Select multiple tasks to perform bulk operations:

- **Bulk Status Update** -- Change the status of many tasks at once.
- **Bulk Update** -- Modify priority, assignee, or dates in batch.

---

## 4. Views

The schedule page offers multiple visualization modes:

### Gantt Chart

The default schedule view. Displays tasks as horizontal bars on a timeline:

- **Timescale zoom**: Use the **D | W | M | Q | Y** buttons in the toolbar to switch between Day, Week, Month (default), Quarter, and Year zoom levels. A **two-tier header** shows coarser units on top (e.g. months) and finer units below (e.g. weeks). Your zoom choice is remembered per schedule.
- **Bar length** represents task duration (start to end date).
- **Bar color** indicates status (blue for in progress, green for completed, gray for pending).
- **Progress fill** shows completion percentage within each bar.
- **Resizable panel splitter**: Drag the vertical bar between the task table and the Gantt timeline to resize the panels. Your chosen width is remembered per schedule. Drag right to reveal more columns, drag left to give more room to the timeline.
- **Left panel columns**: #, Task Name, Pred, Start, End, Duration, Est Days, %, Priority, Assigned, Status. Fixed-width columns stay in place; only Task Name grows/shrinks as you resize.
- **Resizable columns**: Drag the right border of any column header (Pred, Start, End, Duration, Est, %, Priority, Assigned, Status) to resize it. Widths are saved per schedule in localStorage. The Task Name column uses flex width and Row # and Edit Icon columns are fixed.
- **Column show/hide**: Click the **Columns** button in the toolbar to open a dropdown. Toggle any column on/off (except Row #, Task Name, and Edit Icon which are always visible). Click **Reset to default** to restore all columns. Visibility persists per schedule in localStorage.
- **Row expand/collapse**: Parent tasks show a chevron (▶) to the left of their name. Click it to collapse or expand their children. Collapsed parents hide all descendants. Collapsed state persists per schedule in localStorage. Use the **Collapse All** (▶) and **Expand All** (▼) buttons in the toolbar to collapse or expand all parent tasks at once.
- **Inline grid editing**: Click any cell in the left panel to edit it directly — no modal required. Editable fields: Task Name, Predecessor, Start Date, End Date, Duration, Est Days, %, Priority, Assigned To, and Status. Press **Enter** to save, **Escape** to cancel, or just click away (blur saves automatically). A green flash confirms the save. Use **Tab** to advance to the next field and **Shift+Tab** to go back; tabbing past the last field jumps to the first field of the next row. Editing the **Duration** column (e.g. typing `10`) automatically sets End Date = Start Date + 10 days. The row number (#) column is not editable. Double-click a row or click the pencil icon to open the full edit modal instead.
- **Row drag reorder**: Hover over the # column to reveal a drag grip icon (⠿). Drag rows up or down to reorder tasks within the same parent level. A blue border highlights the drop target. New sort order is persisted via the sortOrder field.
- **Multi-select bulk edit**: Click the checkbox in the # header to select all rows, or click individual checkboxes to select specific tasks. Use **Shift+click** for range selection. When tasks are selected, a sticky toolbar appears with dropdowns to bulk-update Status, Priority, or Assignee, plus a Delete button. Press the **Delete** key to bulk-delete selected tasks (with confirmation). Click **Clear** to deselect all.
- **Undo/Redo**: Press **Ctrl+Z** to undo and **Ctrl+Y** (or **Ctrl+Shift+Z**) to redo inline edits, bar drag operations, row reorders, and bulk updates. Undo/redo buttons also appear in the Gantt toolbar with tooltips showing the action description. The undo stack holds up to 50 actions. Delete operations are not undoable.
- **Keyboard navigation**: Use **Arrow keys** to move between cells in the grid like a spreadsheet. Press **Enter** or **F2** to start editing the focused cell. Press **Escape** to clear the focus. Arrow Up/Down also selects the row. Focus is indicated by a blue ring around the cell.
- **Predecessor column (Pred)** shows all predecessors as a comma-separated list in compact row-number format (e.g. "3FS+2d,5SS,7") with a colour-coded health dot: green (done), yellow (in progress), red (overdue). Click to edit inline using the same MS Project notation.
- **Dependency arrows** are drawn for each predecessor individually, colour-coded by that predecessor's health: green for completed, yellow for in-progress, red for overdue.
- **Drag-and-drop rescheduling**: Drag a bar to move the task to new dates. Drag the right edge to resize (change end date only). Changes automatically cascade through dependencies. The timeline **auto-scrolls** when you drag near the left or right edge of the viewport.
- **Interactive dependency drawing**: Hover over a task bar to see connector dots at the left (start) and right (finish) edges. Drag from a dot to another task bar to create a dependency link. The dependency type (FS/SS/FF/SF) is determined by which edges you drag from and to. A dashed blue preview line and target row highlight guide you during the drag.
- **Recurring task indicator**: Template tasks display a repeat icon on their bar.
- **Milestones**: Tasks marked as milestones appear as diamonds instead of bars.
- **PDF Export**: Click the **Print / Export PDF** button in the toolbar to open a print-optimised Gantt ready for saving as PDF.
- Hover over a bar to see task details including all predecessors (row number, task name, dependency type, lag, and health status per predecessor). Click to edit.
- **Column header sort**: Click any column header in the left panel to sort rows ascending, then descending, then back to default (none). A ▲ or ▼ indicator appears in the header to show the active sort direction. Sort preserves task hierarchy — children are sorted within their own sibling group, not mixed across levels. Row drag reorder is disabled while a sort is active.
- **Copy/Paste cells**: Press **Ctrl+C** to copy the focused cell's value to the clipboard. Press **Ctrl+V** to paste the clipboard value into the focused cell (paste only applies when the field types match). A green flash confirms the paste.
- **Baseline bar refinement**: When a baseline is active, ghost bars are shown only for tasks whose baseline dates differ from their current dates. Tasks that are exactly on schedule show no ghost bar, keeping the chart uncluttered.
- **Indent/Outdent**: Press **Tab** to indent the focused task (makes it a child of the task immediately above it). Press **Shift+Tab** to outdent (promotes the task up one level to its parent's parent). Both operations go through the standard update path and are automatically undoable with Ctrl+Z.
- **Bar progress drag**: Hover over the right edge of a task bar's progress fill to reveal a drag handle. Drag left or right to adjust the task's completion percentage directly on the timeline. The change is applied via the standard update path and is automatically undoable with Ctrl+Z.
- **Quick Search (Ctrl+F)**: A search bar in the Gantt toolbar lets you filter tasks by name with type-ahead. Press **Ctrl+F** to focus the search input. Matching is case-insensitive substring. Parent rows stay visible when children match, preserving hierarchy. A **"X / total tasks"** counter shows how many tasks match. Press **Escape** to clear the search.
- **Filter Panel**: Click the **Filter** button (funnel icon) to open a filter panel with multi-select checkboxes for **Status** and **Priority**, a text input for **Assignee**, date pickers for **Start After / Start Before**, and min/max inputs for **Progress %**. All filters combine with AND logic. Parent rows remain visible when descendants match. An active filter count badge appears on the button. Click **"Clear All"** to reset all filters.
- **Saved Views**: The **Saved Views** dropdown in the toolbar lets you save and load named view configurations including visible columns, sort field/direction, and zoom level. Views are stored in localStorage with a `gantt:` prefix (separate from Table views). Select a view to restore its settings instantly, or create/delete views from the dropdown.
- **Row striping**: Alternating row backgrounds (every other row) in both the left task panel and the timeline for improved readability. Stripes are subtle and support dark mode. Active task and hover highlights override the stripe.
- **Resource avatars**: Task bars show a small circle with the assignee's initials at the right edge. Colors are deterministic — the same person always gets the same color. Avatars appear on non-parent, non-milestone bars wider than 40px. Hover over the circle to see the full assignee name.
- **Drag-to-create**: Click and drag on an empty area of the timeline to create a new task. A dashed blue preview rectangle appears while dragging. On release, the Add Task form opens with the start and end dates pre-filled from the drag range. The parent task is auto-detected: dragging on a parent row creates a child task, dragging on a child row creates a sibling. A minimum drag width of half a day prevents accidental creation.
- **Resource overallocation warnings**: Click the **Overalloc** button (warning triangle icon) in the toolbar to highlight tasks with overlapping resource assignments. The system detects when the same person is assigned to multiple tasks with overlapping dates, then marks those bars with an amber border, glow effect, and a small "!" warning dot. A badge on the button shows the total count of flagged bars. The legend adds an "Overallocated" entry when active. Toggle the button off to hide the highlights.
- **Minimap**: A small overview panel (200×80px) appears in the bottom-right corner of the timeline, showing the entire schedule at a glance. Each task is shown as a coloured rectangle matching its status colour. A semi-transparent blue rectangle indicates the currently visible area. Click anywhere on the minimap to jump to that position, or drag the viewport rectangle to scroll proportionally. Toggle the **Map** button in the toolbar to show or hide the minimap. Enabled by default.
- **Touch gestures (mobile/tablet)**: All Gantt drag interactions support touch input for tablets and touch-enabled laptops. Touch-drag a task bar to move or resize it, touch-drag the progress handle to adjust completion percentage, and touch-drag on empty timeline space to create a new task. Single-finger gestures only; page scrolling is suppressed during drag operations.

### Kanban Board

Drag-and-drop card view organized by status columns:

- **Pending** -- Tasks not yet started.
- **In Progress** -- Active work items.
- **Completed** -- Finished tasks.
- **Cancelled** -- Removed tasks.

Drag a card between columns to update its status. Each card shows the task name, priority badge, assignee, and due date.

**WIP Limits** -- Each column supports a configurable Work-In-Progress limit set from the Kanban toolbar. When a column reaches its limit, the column header turns amber to signal congestion. Limits are stored in localStorage per schedule.

### Calendar View

Tasks plotted on a monthly calendar grid. Each day cell shows tasks that are active on that date. Useful for visualizing workload distribution and deadline clustering.

### Table View

A spreadsheet-like view of all tasks with inline editing. Click the **Columns** button (gear icon) to open the column picker. Choose from 22 columns organized into four groups:

- **Standard** -- # (row number, always visible), Name, Status, Priority, Start Date, End Date, Progress, Assigned To (visible by default, inline-editable)
- **Scheduling (CPM)** -- Duration, Early Start, Early Finish, Late Start, Late Finish, Total Float, Free Float, Critical (read-only; enabling any of these triggers CPM computation automatically)
- **Baseline** -- Baseline Start, Baseline End, Start Variance, End Variance (read-only; populated when a baseline comparison is active)
- **Other** -- Predecessor (inline-editable), WBS (read-only; auto-computed from task hierarchy)

The **# column** always appears as the first column and cannot be toggled off. It shows sequential row numbers (1, 2, 3...) based on the current sort order.

The **Predecessor column** displays all predecessors as a comma-separated list in MS Project-style row-number format:
- `3` — Finish-to-Start on row 3 (FS is default, omitted)
- `7SS` — Start-to-Start on row 7
- `3FS+2d` — Finish-to-Start on row 3 with 2-day lag
- `3FS+2d,5SS,7` — three predecessors: rows 3, 5, and 7

Each predecessor in the list shows a **health dot**: green (completed), yellow (in progress), red (overdue). Hover to see the full predecessor task name, type, and lag.

**Inline predecessor editing**: Click the Predecessor cell and type one or more comma-separated entries (e.g. `3`, `5SS`, `7FS+2d`, `3FS+2d,5SS,7`). Press Enter to save. Invalid inputs (bad row number, self-reference, more than 20 predecessors) show a red error. Clear the field to remove all dependencies.

Column selections are saved per schedule and persist across page reloads. All visible columns support sorting. Bulk select, status/priority/assignee changes, and inline cell editing continue to work on the standard columns.

#### Saved Views

Click the **Views** button next to the Columns picker to save and load named view configurations. Each saved view stores the current column selection and sort order. You can:

- **Save** a new view by entering a name and clicking Save
- **Load** a saved view by clicking its name in the dropdown
- **Update** the active view if you've changed columns or sorting since loading it
- **Delete** a view by clicking the trash icon

Saved views are stored per schedule in your browser's localStorage.

### Network Diagram

A node-and-edge graph showing task dependencies. Each task appears as a node, with arrows representing dependency relationships. The critical path is highlighted.

---

## 5. Critical Path

The critical path identifies the longest chain of dependent tasks that determines the minimum project duration.

### Viewing the Critical Path

1. Open a project schedule.
2. Navigate to the **Critical Path** view or panel.
3. Tasks on the critical path are highlighted (typically in red or with a special indicator).

### Key Information

- **Critical tasks** -- Any delay to these tasks directly delays the project end date.
- **Float/Slack** -- Non-critical tasks show their available float (how much they can slip without affecting the project end date).
- **Total duration** -- The calculated minimum project duration based on the critical path.

Use critical path analysis to focus management attention on the tasks that matter most to the timeline.

---

## 6. Baselines

Baselines capture a snapshot of the schedule at a point in time, enabling comparison against the current plan.

### Creating a Baseline

1. Open a schedule with defined tasks.
2. Click **Save Baseline** (or use the baselines panel).
3. Enter a baseline name (e.g., "Original Plan", "Rev 2").
4. The system captures a copy of all task dates, durations, and progress at that moment.

### Comparing Baselines

- View baseline bars alongside current task bars on the Gantt chart.
- Compare planned vs. actual dates to identify schedule drift.
- Use baseline data in EVM calculations (planned value is derived from the baseline).

### Managing Baselines

- List all baselines for a schedule.
- Delete baselines that are no longer needed.
- Multiple baselines can exist per schedule for tracking progressive changes.

---

## 7. Earned Value Management (EVM)

EVM provides objective cost and schedule performance measurement.

### EVM Dashboard

Navigate to the EVM section of a project to see:

- **Planned Value (PV)** -- The budgeted cost of work scheduled.
- **Earned Value (EV)** -- The budgeted cost of work actually performed.
- **Actual Cost (AC)** -- The actual cost incurred.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| SPI (Schedule Performance Index) | EV / PV | > 1.0 = ahead of schedule |
| CPI (Cost Performance Index) | EV / AC | > 1.0 = under budget |
| SV (Schedule Variance) | EV - PV | Positive = ahead |
| CV (Cost Variance) | EV - AC | Positive = under budget |
| EAC (Estimate at Completion) | BAC / CPI | Forecasted total cost |
| ETC (Estimate to Complete) | EAC - AC | Remaining cost forecast |
| TCPI (To-Complete Performance Index) | Remaining work / remaining budget | Required efficiency |

### S-Curve Chart

A visual plot of PV, EV, and AC over time. The S-curve shows:

- Whether the project is ahead or behind schedule (EV vs. PV gap).
- Whether the project is over or under budget (EV vs. AC gap).
- Trend lines for forecasting completion.

### EVM Forecast

The EVM Forecast Dashboard shows:

- **Completion date predictions** based on current SPI.
- **Cost at completion forecasts** based on current CPI.
- **Forecast comparison charts** showing optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic scenarios.
- **AI-generated alerts** when metrics indicate critical or warning thresholds.

### EVM Trend Chart

Track how SPI and CPI change over time to identify whether performance is improving or degrading.

---

## 8. Resources

### Managing Team Members

1. Navigate to the project's **Resources** section.
2. Add team members by assigning them to the project.
3. Set each resource's role, availability, and hourly rate.

### Workload Heatmap

The workload heatmap shows resource utilization across time:

- **Green** -- Under-allocated (available capacity).
- **Yellow** -- Optimally allocated.
- **Red** -- Over-allocated (overloaded).

Hover over a cell to see the specific allocation percentage and assigned tasks for that resource on that date.

### Resource Histogram

A bar chart showing resource demand by time period. Helps identify peaks and valleys in resource requirements.

### Resource Leveling

The resource leveling panel suggests schedule adjustments to resolve over-allocation:

- Review suggested task delay shifts.
- Accept or reject leveling recommendations.
- Apply changes to smooth resource demand.
- **Reassignment suggestions** appear below the delay table for tasks that remain over-allocated. Each row shows the current resource, a suggested alternative (with skill match score), and a "Reassign" button to immediately reassign the task.

### Capacity Chart

Shows planned capacity vs. actual demand for each resource, helping identify where additional resources may be needed.

### Resource Forecast

AI-powered forecasting of future resource bottlenecks based on current task assignments and capacity (configurable up to 8 weeks ahead).

### Rebalance Suggestions

The system analyzes workload across resources and suggests task reassignments to balance the team's load more evenly.

### Resource Availability Calendar

Each resource has an availability calendar in the Team tab. Use it to define when a resource is unavailable or has reduced hours:

1. Select a resource from the dropdown in the Team tab.
2. Click **Add Block** to define an availability entry.
3. Set the date range, type (Vacation, Holiday, Unavailable, or Reduced Hours), and optional note.
4. For Reduced Hours, specify the hours per day available.

The calendar displays a color-coded month view: red for vacation, blue for holiday, gray for unavailable, amber for reduced hours. Navigate months with the arrow buttons. Existing blocks appear in a list below the calendar and can be deleted.

Workload calculations automatically account for availability — if a resource has vacation during a week, their effective capacity is reduced proportionally.

## 9. Workflows

PM Assistant includes a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) workflow engine for automating project processes.

### Creating a Workflow

1. Navigate to **Workflows** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create Workflow**.
3. Define the workflow:
   - **Name** -- Descriptive workflow name.
   - **Description** -- What this workflow automates.
   - **Project** (optional) -- Scope to a specific project, or leave global.

### Workflow Nodes

Build your workflow by adding nodes of these types:

| Node Type   | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Trigger** | Starts the workflow (e.g., task status change, priority escalation, task creation, overdue detection). |
| **Condition** | Evaluates a rule and branches the flow (if/else logic). |
| **Action** | Performs an automated step (e.g., update task status, send notification, invoke agent). |
| **Approval** | Pauses execution until a designated approver accepts or rejects. |
| **Delay** | Waits for a specified duration before continuing. |
| **Agent** | Invokes an AI agent capability (e.g., auto-reschedule) with retry logic. |

### Connecting Nodes

- Draw edges between nodes to define the execution flow.
- Edges can have condition expressions that determine which path to follow.
- Edges can be labeled and sorted for readability.
- The graph must be acyclic (no circular loops).

### Positioning

Each node has optional X/Y position coordinates for visual layout in the workflow editor.

### Triggering a Workflow

Workflows can be triggered:

- **Manually** -- By providing an entity type (e.g., "task") and entity ID.
- **Automatically on task events** -- Creating or updating a task fires matching triggers (status_change, task_created, priority_change, assignment_change, dependency_change).
- **Automatically on project events** -- Budget or status changes on projects fire budget_threshold and project_status_change triggers.
- **Automatically by overdue scanner** -- A 15-minute cron scans for newly-overdue tasks and fires date_passed triggers.

All automatic triggers are non-blocking and will not slow down the originating operation.

### Execution History

Each workflow run creates an execution record:

- View the status of each node in the run (pending, running, completed, failed, waiting_approval).
- See timestamps for when each node started and completed.
- Review input/output data for each step.

### Resuming Approvals

When a workflow reaches an **Approval** node:

1. The workflow pauses and a notification is sent to the approver.
2. The approver reviews the context and either approves or rejects.
3. Use the **Resume** action on the paused node, providing the approval result.
4. The workflow continues along the appropriate branch.

### Sprint Board

During an active sprint, the sprint board provides a Kanban-style view of sprint tasks organized by status columns. Drag cards to update status.

### Sprint Burndown Chart

Track sprint progress with the burndown chart:

- **Ideal burndown** -- A straight line from total points to zero.
- **Actual burndown** -- The real remaining story points over time.
- If the actual line is above the ideal line, the team is behind pace.

### Velocity Chart

View historical velocity across completed sprints. The chart shows story points completed per sprint, helping calibrate future commitments.

### Completing a Sprint

When the sprint period ends:

1. Click **Complete Sprint**.
2. Review completed vs. incomplete tasks.
3. Incomplete tasks can be moved to the next sprint or back to the backlog.

## 13. Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation uses random sampling to model schedule uncertainty and produce probabilistic forecasts.

### Running a Simulation

1. Navigate to **Simulation** in the sidebar.
2. Select a **Project** and **Schedule**.
3. Configure simulation parameters:
   - **Iterations** -- Number of simulation runs (e.g., 1,000 or 10,000). More iterations produce smoother results.
   - **Uncertainty Model** -- The probability distribution for task duration variability (e.g., triangular, PERT, normal).
4. Click **Run Simulation**.

### Interpreting Results

The simulation produces several outputs:

#### Histogram

A frequency distribution of possible project completion dates. The X-axis shows duration in days; the Y-axis shows the number of iterations that resulted in that duration. The cumulative percentage line shows the probability of finishing by a given date.

#### Confidence Levels

A table of key percentiles:

| Percentile | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| P50 | 50% chance of completing by this date |
| P80 | 80% chance -- a common planning target |
| P90 | 90% chance -- conservative estimate |

#### Tornado Diagram (Sensitivity Analysis)

Ranks tasks by their impact on overall schedule variance. Tasks at the top of the tornado have the highest correlation with project duration -- they are your biggest sources of risk.

#### Criticality Index

Shows how often each task appeared on the critical path across all iterations (as a percentage). Tasks with high criticality are frequently critical even when durations vary.

#### Cost Forecast

If cost data is available, the simulation also produces probabilistic cost forecasts (P50, P80, P90, mean, and standard deviation).

#### Statistics

- **Mean duration** -- The average project duration across all iterations.
- **Standard deviation** -- The spread of possible outcomes.
- **Min/Max** -- The best-case and worst-case durations observed.

### Auto-Reschedule

When delays are detected, the AI can suggest schedule adjustments that minimize overall project impact. Review and accept or reject proposed changes.

### Task Slip Predictions

In the **AI Insights** tab of any project, the Task Slip Predictions section shows which tasks are most likely to slip. Each task is scored (0-100%) based on:

- Whether it's already overdue
- Progress gap (actual vs expected)
- Incomplete predecessor tasks
- Task duration (longer = higher risk)

Tasks are shown sorted by slip probability with color-coded bars and suggested actions.

### Scope Creep Detector

Also in the **AI Insights** tab, the Scope Creep Detector compares the current project state against its baseline. It shows:

- New tasks added since the baseline
- Estimate growth (total days added)
- Open change requests
- Schedule health percentage

A severity badge (Low/Medium/High/Critical) flags the degree of scope drift. Create a baseline first to enable this feature.

### Status Report Generator

If an executed proposal caused unintended effects, admins can click **Rollback** to reverse all changes to their original state.

### Providing Feedback

After a proposal has been executed, you can submit feedback on whether it was effective. Choose from:

- **Effective** -- The changes solved the problem.
- **Partially effective** -- Helped but didn't fully resolve the issue.
- **Ineffective** -- No meaningful impact.
- **Made worse** -- The changes had a negative effect.

Feedback improves future agent confidence scoring and proposal quality.

### Risk Levels

Each proposal has a risk level that determines its approval requirements:

| Risk Level | Meaning | Examples |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Low** | Read-only analysis, notifications | Pattern detection, risk aggregation |
| **Medium** | Modifying task dates, updating progress | Moving a due date, adjusting estimates |
| **High** | Resource changes, dependency modifications | Reassigning team members, adding dependencies |
| **Critical** | Budget or scope changes | Reallocating budget, removing milestones |

## 28. Notifications Center Page

The full-page Notifications Center is available at `/notifications`. Access it from the sidebar ("Notifications" under Workspace) or by clicking "View all alerts" in the notification bell dropdown.

### Severity Summary Cards

At the top of the page, four clickable cards show counts for **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, and **Low** notifications. Click any card to filter the list to only that severity level.

### Filtering

Use the filter panel to narrow the notification list:

- **Type** -- Filter by notification type: Risk, Budget, Schedule, Resource, and others.
- **Severity** -- Filter by severity level (or click a summary card above).

### Notification List

Each notification entry displays:

- A **severity color bar** on the left edge (red for critical, orange for high, yellow for medium, blue for low).
- A **type icon** matching the notification category.
- The **title** and **message** body.
- **Time ago** (e.g., "2 hours ago").
- **Type label** and **project name**.

### Managing Notifications

- Click the **mark read** button on any individual notification to dismiss it. The read state is saved to the server so it persists across page refreshes and sessions.
- Click **"Mark all read"** at the top of the list to mark all notifications as read at once.
- Click **"Load More"** at the bottom of the list to fetch additional notifications. The list loads in pages so the initial view stays fast even on accounts with many notifications.

## 30. Dashboard & Projects

The Dashboard and Projects pages provide a lean, action-oriented project management experience.

### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

Access via the sidebar under **Plan → Dashboard**.

- **Scope Toggle** — Switch between "My Projects" and "All Projects" to control which data is displayed.
- **KPI Tiles** — 6 tiles showing Portfolio Health, Overdue Tasks, Open Risks, At-Risk Projects, Budget Variance, and Budget Utilization. Each has a colored status dot and click-through to drill-in pages.
- **Portfolio Intelligence** — AI-generated health ring, risk chips, budget status, and key insights. Supports dark mode.
- **Action Center** — Two columns: "Today's Priorities" (deadline-driven items) and "AI Next Best Actions" (proposals, notifications, at-risk projects to act on).
- **Projects Table** — Sortable table; clicking a row navigates to the project detail view (`/project/:id`).
- **Customize** — Toggle widgets on/off. Opt-in widgets (Sprint Snapshot, Goals Progress, Team Workload) are available but disabled by default.

### Projects (`/projects`)

Access via the sidebar under **Plan → Projects**.

- **Filter Bar** — Search by name, filter by health band and status.
- **AI Portfolio Insights** — 3 insight tiles pulled from analytics summary.
- **Project Cards** — Grid of cards with health-based left borders, status/priority chips, and progress meters. Clicking a card navigates to `/project/:id` with full Gantt/Kanban/Calendar/EVM detail.
- **New Project** — Create from template via the template picker.

- **Left Panel** — Tabbed view: Tasks, Risks, Issues, Milestones, RAID, Documents. Each tab shows a filterable list with inline Add buttons.
- **Right Rail** — Sticky panel with Project Health ring (schedule/budget/risk sub-scores), AI Assistant card, and Activity Feed.

## 31. RAID Log

The RAID Log is a project-level register for Risks, Actions, Issues, and Decisions. Access it from the **RAID** tab on any project detail page (or via the RAID tab in the PM Project Detail view).

### Creating Records

The RAID log header contains four **Add** buttons, one per type:

- **+ Risk** — Opens the Risk form. Fill in title, description, severity (low / medium / high / critical), probability, impact, owner, and optional mitigation plan. Click **Save** to create. The record is assigned the next `R-NNN` ID automatically.
- **+ Issue** — Opens the Issue form. Issues have their own fields distinct from risks: title, description, severity, category, owner, root cause ("Why did this happen?"), impact assessment, workaround ("Temporary fix"), resolution plan ("Permanent fix"), and target resolution date. Probability is not shown since the issue has already occurred. Assigned an `I-NNN` ID.
- **+ Action** — Opens the Action form. Fill in title, description, owner, due date, and action type (Follow-Up / Decision Required / Information Only / Escalation). Assigned an `A-NNN` ID.
- **+ Decision** — Opens the Decision form. Fill in title, description, decided by, rationale, decision date, and alternatives considered. Assigned a `D-NNN` ID.

All forms include a **Source** field (Manual / AI Scan / Agent / Import) that is set automatically when records are created by the AI Scan or an agent.

**All team members** can raise RAID items — open identification of risks, issues, actions, and decisions is encouraged per PMI/PRINCE2 governance best practice.

### Triage Workflow

Items raised by non-PM roles (team members, QA, testers, DevOps, BAs) are created with status **Proposed** and require PM review before becoming active. Items raised by PMs, admins, scrum masters, risk managers, or PMO bypass triage and go straight to **Open**.

When a Proposed item is created, all project managers and owners receive a notification: *"New [Type] requires triage: [Title]"*. The PM reviews the item and either:

- **Promotes** it to `open` (or the appropriate starting status for its type)
- **Cancels** it with a reason if it is not valid

This keeps the active register curated while ensuring that threats identified by any team member are captured and reviewed.

### Searching and Filtering

Above the RAID table, a toolbar provides:

- **Search box** — Filters records by title or description as you type.
- **Type** dropdown — Show all types or filter to Risks, Issues, Actions, or Decisions only.
- **Status** dropdown — Filter by a specific status (proposed, open, in_progress, resolved, closed, cancelled, etc.).
- **Severity** dropdown — Filter to a specific severity level (low, medium, high, critical).
- **Source** dropdown — Filter by how the record was created (manual, ai_scan, agent, import).

Filters combine — you can, for example, show only open critical Risks created by AI Scan.

### Stats Row

At the top of the RAID log, a stats bar shows at-a-glance counts:

- **Total** — All active (non-cancelled, non-closed) records in the log.
- **Open Risks** — Risks in `open` or `monitoring` status.
- **Open Issues** — Issues in `open` or `in_progress` status.
- **Open Actions** — Actions in `open`, `in_progress`, or `deferred` status.
- **Pending Decisions** — Decisions in `pending_decision` status.

These counts update immediately whenever a record is created, updated, or cancelled.

### Slide-Out Detail Panel

Click any row in the RAID table to open the detail panel on the right side of the screen without leaving the page. The panel shows:

- The record's full header: sequential ID (e.g., `R-007`), type badge, current status pill, and severity chip.
- All fields for that record type, editable inline for users with the appropriate role.
- An **Activity Timeline** at the bottom of the panel — a chronological list of every status change, field edit, cancel/reverse action, and manual comment. Each entry shows the actor name, relative timestamp, and a description of what changed.

Close the panel by clicking outside it or pressing **Escape**.

### Adding Comments

In the detail panel, a comment box appears below the activity timeline. Type your comment and press **Add Comment**. The comment appears immediately in the timeline with your name and the current time. Comments are permanent — they cannot be edited or deleted.

### Cancelling a Record

To cancel a record (instead of deleting it — RAID records are never deleted):

1. Open the detail panel for the record.
2. Click **Cancel Record**.
3. Enter a mandatory cancellation reason in the prompt.
4. Confirm. The record status changes to `cancelled` and the reason is logged in the activity timeline.

Cancelled records remain visible in the log and can be found by filtering Status = cancelled. The sequential ID is not reused.

### Reversing a Decision (Admin Only)

If a Decision record has been marked `decided` and needs to be formally reversed:

1. Open the detail panel for the Decision record.
2. Click **Reverse Decision** (visible to admin users only).
3. Enter a mandatory reason for the reversal.
4. Confirm. Status changes to `reversed` and the reason is logged in the timeline.

Reversal is a formal governance action and cannot be undone through the UI.

### AI Scan

The **AI Scan** button in the RAID toolbar triggers a project-scoped analysis:

1. Click **AI Scan**.
2. The AI reads the current schedule, task statuses, overdue items, budget data, and existing RAID entries.
3. A preview panel shows suggested new Risks and Issues with titles, descriptions, and severity assessments.
4. Check the records you want to import and click **Import Selected**.
5. Selected records are created in the RAID log tagged as `source: ai_scan`.

AI Scan does not overwrite or modify existing records — it only proposes new ones.

## Tips

- **Save often** -- Always click Save after modifying schedules or tasks. Unsaved changes are lost on page refresh.
- **Use the Command Palette** -- Ctrl+K is the fastest way to navigate anywhere in the application.
- **Check notifications** -- The bell icon alerts you to approvals, delays, and assignment changes.
- **Leverage AI** -- Use Ask AI for quick data lookups, and AI Task Breakdown when starting a new project.
- **Set baselines early** -- Create a baseline as soon as the initial plan is approved, before work begins.
- **Review EVM weekly** -- SPI and CPI trends provide early warning of schedule and cost problems.
