# PM Assistant – Citizen Guide

This guide is for **citizens** who use the PM Assistant to **view region information**, **notices**, and **project status** — no project management or editing.

---

## Viewing region information (no login)

1. Open the PM Assistant (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`).
2. On the **landing page**, you’ll see a list of **regions** (e.g. Guyana’s 10 administrative regions).
3. Click a **region** (e.g. **Barima-Waini**, **Demerara-Mahaica**).
4. You’ll go to the **Region Info** page for that region.

You can view this **without signing in**.

## Region Info page tabs

The Region Info page has three tabs:

### 1. Overview

- **Content sections** published by the region (e.g. About, Contact, Services, Location).
- Use this to learn about the region, how to contact them, and what services they offer.

### 2. Notices & announcements

- **Published notices** from the region (e.g. project updates, public meetings, maintenance).
- Notices may show **title**, **content**, **category**, **priority**, and **expiry**.
- Expired notices are hidden automatically.

### 3. Project status

- **Projects** in the region that are visible to the public.
- You’ll typically see **name**, **status** (e.g. Planning, Active, Completed), and **dates**.
- This is a **read-only** summary; you cannot edit projects here.

## If you have a citizen account

- You can **sign in** with your citizen account.
- After login, **choose your region** on the landing page to go to that region’s **Region Info** page.
- You still only **view** content, notices, and projects; you don’t manage them.

---

## Tips

- **No login required** – You can view region info and notices without an account.
- **Mobile-friendly** – The region page works on phones and tablets.
- **Updates** – Regions update notices and project status regularly; refresh the page to see the latest.
