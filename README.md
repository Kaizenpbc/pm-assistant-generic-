# PM Assistant

**Enterprise Project Management Platform with Agentic AI**

A full-featured, production-grade project management SaaS application combining traditional PM methodologies (CPM, EVM, Agile) with an autonomous AI agent system. 14 specialized agents continuously monitor projects, reason about issues via Claude, and propose (or auto-execute) corrective actions — all with human-in-the-loop governance, confidence scoring, and full audit trails. Built with Fastify, React, and the Anthropic Claude SDK.

- Gantt drag-and-drop rescheduling (move and resize task bars)
- Gantt interactive dependency drawing: drag from connector dots on task bar edges to another task to create FS/SS/FF/SF links visually (MS Project-style)
- Gantt inline grid editing: click any cell in the left panel to edit directly (name, dates, duration, %, priority, assignee, status, predecessors) with Tab navigation across cells and rows
- Gantt column header sort (asc/desc/none, hierarchy-preserving), copy/paste cells (Ctrl+C/V), indent/outdent (Tab/Shift+Tab), bar progress drag
- Gantt quick search (Ctrl+F) with type-ahead filtering, filter panel (status, priority, assignee, date range, progress), and saved views (columns, sort, zoom via localStorage)
- Gantt multi-select bars: click/Ctrl+click/Shift+click bars to select, blue highlight + box-shadow, bulk drag-move all selected bars together
- Gantt zoom-to-fit: auto-selects zoom level to fit all tasks in the viewport
- Gantt float/slack visualization: hatched yellow extensions on non-critical bars showing available float days (requires critical path enabled)
- Gantt row striping: alternating row backgrounds in both left panel and timeline for improved readability (dark mode aware)
- Gantt resource avatars: assignee initials circles on task bars with deterministic color palette
- Gantt drag-to-create: click-drag on empty timeline area to create a task with pre-filled start/end dates and auto-detected parent

```

- **Frontend** is a Vite-built React SPA served as static files by LiteSpeed. Production bundle uses manual chunk splitting (`vendor-react`, `vendor-query`) defined in `vite.config.ts` to improve cache efficiency.
- **Backend** is a Fastify app running under Passenger, handling all `/api/v1/` routes.
- **Analytics & SEO** — GA4 (measurement ID `G-F99Q92ED7M`) is loaded in `index.html` (hardcoded, no env var). `index.html` also includes Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags. `public/robots.txt` and `public/sitemap.xml` are included for search engine indexing.
- **Repository layer** (`BaseRepository` + entity repos) centralizes SQL and row mapping for core entities; services keep business logic.
- **Structured metrics** via `MetricsService` (request counts, latency percentiles, AI token usage). Admin endpoint: `GET /api/v1/metrics`.
- **Request context** propagated via `AsyncLocalStorage` — request ID included in all log entries.
- **WebSocket** connections are managed by `@fastify/websocket` for real-time updates.
- **MCP Server** runs as a separate process, exposing PM tools via the Model Context Protocol.

## MCP Server

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server exposes 83 tools across 15 groups and 6 read-only resources. Tools are **role-filtered** — each user only sees tools their role permits.

**Tool Groups:** Projects, Schedules, Tasks, Sprints, Resources, Time Tracking, Approvals, Reports, AI Insights (health, risks, budget, spend-to-date, burn rate, EVM, Monte Carlo, risk mitigations, meeting summaries), Auto-Reschedule, Intake, Custom Fields, Integrations, Admin, Templates.

**Resources:** `project://{id}/summary`, `project://{id}/tasks`, `project://{id}/risks`, `project://{id}/financials`, `project://{id}/schedule`.

**Roles:** `admin`, `executive`, `project_manager`, `team_member`, `scrum_master`, `finance_officer`, `risk_manager`, `pmo`, `ba`, `qa`, `tester`, `devops`, `claude_sme` — see `mcp-server/src/permissions.ts` for the full permission matrix.

**Auth:** OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (HTTP mode) or API key (STDIO mode). Role is resolved from the user's database record, not inferred from scopes.

See `mcp-server/` for setup instructions and tool definitions.
