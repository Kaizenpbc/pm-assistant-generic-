# PM Assistant -- Product Manual

## Product Overview

PM Assistant is an enterprise-grade project management platform built with TypeScript, React, and Fastify. It combines traditional PM discipline (CPM, EVM, baselines) with AI-powered intelligence (auto-reschedule, natural language queries, predictive analytics) in a single SaaS application. The platform supports the full project lifecycle from intake through execution, monitoring, and closeout.

---

## 1. Project Management

### Projects

Full CRUD lifecycle for projects with the following attributes:

- **Status tracking**: planning, active, on_hold, completed, cancelled
- **Priority levels**: low, medium, high, urgent
- **Methodology**: waterfall (default), agile, or hybrid. Controls the presentation layer — tab ordering, readiness bar steps, context cards, and default view mode. Does not restrict feature access (e.g., waterfall projects can still use sprints).
- **Budget management**: allocated budget, spent budget, budget variance
- **Date management**: start date, end date, auto-calculated duration
- **Team assignment**: project members with role-based access (owner, manager, editor, viewer). Only members can access a project; non-members get 404. Creator is auto-added as owner. Admin/pmo bypass membership; executive gets read-only bypass.

### Schedules

Each project contains one or more schedules. A schedule groups tasks into a logical timeline and serves as the unit for critical path analysis, baselines, and Monte Carlo simulation.

### Tasks

Tasks are the atomic unit of work. Each task supports:

- Status: pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled
- Priority: low, medium, high, urgent
- Multiple predecessor dependencies (up to 20 per task) with type and lag per dependency
- Estimated duration (days) and work effort
- Assigned resource
- Parent-child hierarchy (subtasks)
- Risk and issue annotations
- Progress percentage tracking
- Recurring task support (daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly) with auto-generation

### Recurring Tasks

Tasks can be marked as recurring templates with an RRULE-style recurrence rule. Supported frequencies:

- **Daily** — generates a new task instance every day
- **Weekly / Biweekly** — with selectable days of the week (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)
- **Monthly** — on a specific day of the month

A daily cron job (02:00 UTC) scans for templates and generates instances within a 14-day horizon. Generated instances link back to their parent template via `recurrence_parent_id`. Template tasks appear in the Gantt chart with a repeat icon.

### Views

- **Gantt chart** -- interactive timeline with dependency arrows and critical path highlighting. **Five zoom levels** (Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year) with a **two-tier timescale header** (e.g. months over weeks, years over months). Zoom selection persists per schedule via localStorage. A **draggable splitter** between the task table and timeline lets you resize the panels; width persists per schedule. The left panel shows 11 columns: row number (#), task name, predecessor (row-number format with health dot), start date, end date, duration, estimated days, progress %, priority, assigned to, and status. Drag the splitter to reveal or hide columns. **Resizable columns**: drag column borders in the header to resize; widths persist per schedule in localStorage. **Column picker**: Columns button in toolbar toggles column visibility; # and Task Name always visible; persists per schedule. **Row expand/collapse**: parent tasks have a chevron toggle to collapse/expand children; persists in localStorage. **Collapse All / Expand All** buttons in toolbar toggle all parent tasks at once. **Inline grid editing**: click any cell (except row #) to edit directly — text inputs for name/assignee, date pickers for start/end, number inputs for est days/%, select dropdowns for priority/status, and MS Project notation for predecessors. Tab/Shift+Tab navigates across fields and rows. Duration edits auto-compute end date. Enter saves, Escape cancels, blur auto-saves, green flash confirms. **Row drag reorder**: hover over the # column for a drag grip; drag rows up/down within the same parent level. **Multi-select bulk edit**: checkbox selection with Shift+click range select; sticky toolbar for bulk status/priority/assignee changes and delete. Delete key triggers bulk delete with confirmation. **Undo/Redo**: Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y (up to 50 actions) for inline edits, bar drags, reorders, and bulk updates; undo/redo buttons in toolbar with tooltips. **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys move between cells, Enter/F2 to edit, Escape to clear focus. Supports drag-and-drop rescheduling: drag a bar to move a task, drag the right edge to resize; timeline auto-scrolls when dragging near viewport edges. Date changes cascade through dependencies automatically. Dependency arrows are colour-coded by predecessor health: green (completed), yellow (in progress), red (overdue/at risk). Hover over a bar to see predecessor details including row number, task name, and health status. **Column header sort**: click any column header to cycle through ascending/descending/none; sort indicator (▲/▼) shown in header; sorts within sibling groups to preserve hierarchy; row drag reorder disabled while sort is active. **Copy/Paste cells**: Ctrl+C copies the focused cell value to clipboard; Ctrl+V pastes into the focused cell (same field type only); green flash confirms. **Baseline bar refinement**: ghost bars are rendered only when a task's baseline dates differ from its current dates, eliminating visual noise for on-schedule tasks. **Indent/Outdent**: Tab indents the focused task (makes it a child of the task above); Shift+Tab outdents (promotes to parent's parent); both operations go through onTaskUpdate and are undoable. **Bar progress drag**: drag the progress fill edge in a task bar to set completion percentage; visible handle appears on hover; change is undoable via Ctrl+Z.
- **Kanban board** -- drag-and-drop cards grouped by status
- **Calendar view** -- tasks plotted on a monthly/weekly calendar
- **Table view** -- sortable, filterable spreadsheet-style listing with a customizable column picker. Choose from 22 columns across four groups (Standard, Scheduling/CPM, Baseline, Other). The **# (row number)** column is always visible and shows sequential numbering. The **Predecessor** column displays dependencies in compact MS Project-style row-number format (e.g. "3", "7SS+2d") with colour-coded health badges: green dot (predecessor completed), yellow dot (in progress), red dot (overdue). Predecessors are **inline-editable** — click and type a row number with optional type and lag. Column selections persist per schedule. Scheduling columns automatically trigger CPM computation. Baseline columns show variance data when a baseline comparison is active. **Saved Views** let you name and store column+sort configurations; load, update, or delete them from the Views dropdown.

### Bulk Operations

Bulk create, update, and status-change endpoints allow operating on multiple tasks or projects in a single request.

### Search

Full-text search across 9 entity types: projects, tasks, RAID items (risks/issues/actions/decisions), goals, lessons learned, resources, change requests, sprints, and task comments. All queries execute in parallel and return a unified result set; any entity type that fails is silently omitted so a partial outage does not block the entire search.

**Enriched results** include contextual fields beyond just name/description/status:
- **Tasks**: priority, assigned_to, progress_percentage, start_date, end_date
- **RAID items**: severity, record_id, category, type (risk/issue/action/decision)
- **Goals**: progress, goal_type, owner_id
- **Resources**: role, skills, is_active
- **Sprints**: goal, start_date, end_date
- **Comments**: text (truncated to 120 chars), task_name

**Optional query parameters:**
- `type` — comma-separated entity types to search (e.g., `?q=budget&type=task,risk`)
- `project` — scope results to a specific project ID (e.g., `?q=deploy&project=abc-123`)
- `status` — filter by status value (e.g., `?q=deploy&status=in_progress`)

**Response shape:** `{ results: [...], total: number, queryMs: number }`

---

## 2. Critical Path and Baselines

### Critical Path Method (CPM)

The `CriticalPathService` performs a full forward and backward pass across the task dependency graph to compute:

- **Early Start (ES)** and **Early Finish (EF)** for every task
- **Late Start (LS)** and **Late Finish (LF)**
- **Total float** and **free float**
- **Critical path identification** -- tasks with zero total float
- **Project duration** -- the minimum schedule span

Results feed into Gantt chart highlighting, Monte Carlo simulation, and resource leveling.

### Baselines

The `BaselineService` captures point-in-time snapshots of a schedule. Each baseline records every task's start date, end date, estimated days, progress, and status. Baselines are immutable once created.

### Variance Tracking

Comparing a baseline against current schedule state produces per-task variance metrics:

- Start variance (days slipped)
- End variance (days slipped)
- Duration variance (longer or shorter than planned)
- Progress variance (percentage points ahead or behind)
- Status change detection

---

## 3. Earned Value Management (EVM)

### S-Curve Data

The `SCurveService` computes cumulative Planned Value (PV), Earned Value (EV), and Actual Cost (AC) data points over time, derived from task durations, progress percentages, and project budgets. These data points render as the classic S-curve chart.

### EVM Metrics

Standard earned value indicators computed from S-curve data:

| Metric | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| CPI | EV / AC | Cost Performance Index |
| SPI | EV / PV | Schedule Performance Index |
| CV | EV - AC | Cost Variance |
| SV | EV - PV | Schedule Variance |
| EAC | BAC / CPI | Estimate at Completion |
| ETC | EAC - AC | Estimate to Complete |
| VAC | BAC - EAC | Variance at Completion |

### EVM Forecasting

The `EVMForecastService` extends basic EVM with AI-powered forecasting:

- Predicted CPI and SPI for the next 4 weeks based on trend momentum
- AI-adjusted EAC with confidence range (low/high)
- Trend direction assessment: improving, stable, or deteriorating
- Cost overrun probability (0-100%)
- Corrective action recommendations with effort, priority, and estimated impact
- Narrative summary in plain language

### Early Warnings

Proactive alerts fire when CPI or SPI drop below configurable thresholds, enabling intervention before projects go off-track.

### EVM Dashboard Page (`/evm`)

A dedicated analytics page for earned value management, accessible from the sidebar under the **Analyze** section. Features:

- **Project selector** dropdown to choose which project to analyze.
- **Six KPI cards**: CPI, SPI, EV, PV, AC, BAC with color-coded values (green when healthy, red when critical).
- **Four forecast cards**: EAC, ETC, VAC, TCPI with red warning borders when thresholds are exceeded.
- **CPI/SPI Trend chart**: SVG line chart with blue CPI line, green SPI line, 1.0 baseline reference, and labeled axes.
- **Early Warnings panel**: color-coded alert cards (critical = red, warning = amber, info = blue).
- **Forecast Comparison table**: multiple forecasting methods with EAC values and BAC variance.
- **AI Predictions section** (when `AI_ENABLED=true`): AI-adjusted EAC with confidence range, overrun probability, trend direction, narrative summary, and corrective actions with priority badges.

Uses the existing `getEVMForecast()` API.

---

## 4. Resource Management

### Resource Pool

The `ResourceService` maintains a central resource registry. Each resource has:

- Name, email, role
- Capacity (hours per week, default 40)
- Skill tags
- Active/inactive status
- Cost rate ($/hour, optional) — used in portfolio cost projections

The `GET /api/v1/resources` endpoint supports pagination via `?limit=` and `?offset=` query parameters (default limit 50, max 200). The response includes a `total` count for client-side pagination controls.

All major list endpoints use a shared pagination schema (`paginationSchema.ts`) with consistent defaults (limit 1–200, default 50; offset ≥ 0). Paginated endpoints return a `PaginatedResponse<T>` containing `data`, `total`, `page`, `pageSize`, and `totalPages`. The following endpoints support pagination:

- `GET /api/v1/projects` — user's projects
- `GET /api/v1/resources` — resource pool
- `GET /api/v1/schedules/:id/tasks` — tasks within a schedule
- `GET /api/v1/sprints/project/:projectId` — sprints for a project
- `GET /api/v1/templates` — project templates

### Workload Heatmap

The resource workload endpoint aggregates task assignments across projects to produce a per-resource, per-day demand profile. Over-allocated days are flagged.

### Resource Histogram

The `ResourceLevelingService` generates daily demand histograms showing hours demanded vs. capacity for each resource. Over-allocations are returned as structured data for visualization.

### Resource Leveling

When over-allocations are detected, the leveling algorithm shifts non-critical tasks within their float to smooth demand below capacity. The result includes:

- Original vs. leveled demand profiles
- List of adjusted tasks with original and new dates
- Remaining over-allocations (if any cannot be resolved within float)
- **Reassignment suggestions** — for tasks that remain over-allocated after delay adjustments, the system suggests alternative resources based on skill matching. Each suggestion includes the current and suggested resource, a match score, and a one-click "Reassign" button

### Resource Optimization

The `ResourceOptimizerService` uses AI to analyze resource utilization patterns and recommend:

- Reallocation of underutilized resources
- Load balancing across team members
- Skill-based assignment optimization

### Resource Availability Calendar

Each resource has an availability calendar accessible from the Team tab. Managers can define blocks of time when a resource is unavailable or has reduced hours:

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Vacation** | Resource fully unavailable for the date range |
| **Holiday** | Resource fully unavailable (company-wide) |
| **Unavailable** | Generic unavailability |
| **Reduced Hours** | Resource available for fewer hours/day |

The calendar displays a color-coded month grid (red=vacation, blue=holiday, gray=unavailable, amber=reduced). Workload heatmap calculations automatically account for availability blocks — when a resource has vacation during a week, their effective capacity is reduced proportionally.

**API endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/resources/:resourceId/availability?from=&to=`
- `POST /api/v1/resources/:resourceId/availability`
- `PUT /api/v1/resources/availability/:id`
- `DELETE /api/v1/resources/availability/:id`

### Resource Management Page (`/resources`)

A dedicated page accessible from the sidebar under the **Analyze** section. Features:

- **Project selector** dropdown to choose which project to view.
- **Summary cards**: Total Resources, Over-allocated count, Average Utilization.
- **Four tabs**:
  - **Team** — Full table of all resources with create, edit, and delete capabilities. Managers can add new resources, update roles/capacity/cost rates, and remove resources directly from this tab.
  - **Workload Heatmap** — Table showing all resources with weekly utilization percentages as colored cells (green < 80%, blue 80–100%, amber 100–120%, red > 120%). Displays resource name, role, average utilization, and per-week cells.
  - **Resource Histogram** — SVG bar chart per resource showing daily demand hours with an 8-hour capacity line. Red bars for over-allocated days. Includes an over-allocation summary with count and details.
  - **Capacity Forecast** — 8-week bottleneck predictions table (resource, week, demand, capacity, severity) and AI-generated recommendations.

Uses existing APIs: `getResourceWorkload()`, `getResourceHistogram()`, `getResourceForecast()`.

## 5. Workflow Automation (DAG Engine)

### Overview

The `DagWorkflowService` implements a directed acyclic graph (DAG) execution engine. Workflows are composed of nodes connected by edges, with optional condition expressions on edges for branching.

### Node Types

| Node Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Trigger** | Entry point -- fires on entity events (e.g., task status change, priority escalation, task creation) |
| **Condition** | Evaluates a boolean expression against execution context |
| **Action** | Executes a side effect (update task, send notification, invoke agent, log activity) |
| **Approval** | Pauses execution until an authorized user approves or rejects |
| **Delay** | Pauses execution for a configurable duration |
| **Agent** | Invokes a registered AI agent capability with retry logic and configurable backoff |

### Trigger Types

| Trigger | Fires When | Optional Filters |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| `status_change` | Task status changes | `fromStatus`, `toStatus` |
| `progress_threshold` | Progress crosses a threshold | `progressThreshold`, `progressDirection` |
| `date_passed` | Task end date is in the past | -- |
| `task_created` | New task is created (oldTask is null) | `statusFilter` |
| `priority_change` | Task priority changes | `toPriority` |
| `assignment_change` | Task assignee changes | `toAssignee` |
| `dependency_change` | Task dependency changes | -- |
| `budget_threshold` | Project budget utilization crosses threshold | `thresholdPercent` |
| `project_status_change` | Project status changes | `fromStatus`, `toStatus` |
| `manual` | Triggered via API | -- |

### Action Types

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `update_field` | Updates a task field to a specified value |
| `log_activity` | Logs an activity entry on the task |
| `send_notification` | Creates a real notification via NotificationService (notifies the project manager) |
| `invoke_agent` | Invokes a registered agent capability inline (e.g., auto-reschedule) |

### Event-Driven Execution

Workflows are triggered automatically by task and project lifecycle events:

- **Task events:** `ScheduleService.createTask()` and `updateTask()` call `evaluateTaskChange()` (fire-and-forget)
- **Project events:** `ProjectService.update()` calls `evaluateProjectChange()` on budget or status changes
- **Overdue scanner:** A 15-minute cron in `AgentSchedulerService` detects newly-overdue tasks and fires `date_passed` triggers

All event-driven calls are non-blocking -- they use `.catch()` so workflow failures never break task or project operations.

### Natural Language Workflow Builder

Users can generate workflow definitions from plain English descriptions:

1. Navigate to **Workflows** in the sidebar.
2. In the **Generate with AI** section, type a description of the desired automation (10-500 characters).
3. Click **Generate** — the AI analyzes available triggers, actions, and conditions and returns a complete workflow definition.
4. The generated workflow populates the editor form for review. Users can edit nodes, add/remove steps, and adjust configuration before saving.
5. Click **Create Workflow** to save.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/workflows/generate` with `{ description: string, projectId?: string }`. Requires `write` scope.

The system prompt enumerates all available trigger types, action types, condition operators, and node types so the AI produces valid, executable workflows.

### Execution Model

- Each workflow definition is versioned and can be project-scoped or global
- Edges support condition expressions and sort ordering for deterministic branching
- Execution state is persisted per-node with statuses: pending, running, completed, failed, skipped, waiting
- Full execution history is retained with start/end timestamps and error messages
- Executions can be running, completed, failed, cancelled, or waiting (paused at an approval or delay node)
- All workflow actions are recorded in the audit ledger

---

## 6. Approval and Change Management

### Approval Workflows

The `ApprovalWorkflowService` defines multi-step approval chains scoped to a project and entity type. Each step specifies an approver role and execution order.

### Change Requests

Change requests capture proposed modifications with:

- Title, description, category, and priority
- Impact summary
- Status progression through workflow steps
- Link to an approval workflow (optional)
- Full action history with comments per step

### Approval Actions

Each step in a change request records: who acted, what action they took (approve/reject), optional comment, and timestamp. All actions are written to the audit ledger.

---

## 7. Sprint / Agile

### Sprint Planning

The `SprintService` manages time-boxed iterations with:

- Sprint name, goal, start date, end date
- Status: planning, active, completed
- Task assignment to sprints
- Sprint capacity tracking

### Sprint Board

A Kanban-style board scoped to a single sprint, showing tasks grouped by status with drag-and-drop support.

### Burndown Charts

The `BurndownService` computes daily remaining work for a sprint, producing the classic burndown line. Ideal burndown is plotted alongside actual for comparison.

### Velocity Tracking

Historical sprint velocity (story points or task count completed per sprint) is tracked across sprints to support future capacity planning.

---

## 8. Time Tracking

### Time Entries

The `TimeEntryService` records individual time logs:

- Associated task and project
- Hours worked, date, description
- Billable flag
- Created-by user

### Timesheets

Aggregated time entry views per user per week, suitable for approval workflows and payroll integration. The Timesheet page includes a **"Log Time"** button that opens an inline form with project, schedule, and task dropdowns plus date, hours, and description fields, allowing time entries to be created directly from the timesheet without navigating away. Mobile week navigation icons are also displayed correctly on small screens.

### Actual vs. Estimated

Compare logged hours against task estimated effort to identify underestimation patterns and improve future planning accuracy.

---

## 9. Custom Fields

### Per-Project Field Definitions

The `CustomFieldService` allows each project to define additional metadata fields:

| Field Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **text** | Free-form string |
| **number** | Numeric value |
| **date** | Date picker |
| **dropdown** | Single-select from predefined options |
| **checkbox** | Boolean toggle |

Custom field values are stored per-entity (task, project) and included in search, filtering, and report outputs.

---

## 10. File Attachments

### Upload and Storage

The `FileAttachmentService` handles file uploads with:

- Configurable storage backend
- File size and type validation
- Unique file naming to prevent collisions

### Versioning

Multiple versions of a file can be uploaded to the same attachment slot. Previous versions are retained.

### Entity Linking

Attachments can be linked to any entity type (project, task, change request) via entity_type and entity_id references.

---

## 11. Monte Carlo Simulation

### Probabilistic Schedule Analysis

The `MonteCarloService` runs configurable simulations (default: 10,000 iterations) over the task dependency graph using PERT or triangular distributions derived from optimistic, most-likely, and pessimistic duration estimates.

### Outputs

- **Confidence levels**: P50, P80, P90 (or any custom percentiles) for project completion duration
- **Histogram**: distribution of simulated project durations in configurable bin widths
- **Sensitivity analysis**: which tasks contribute most to overall schedule variance
- **Criticality index**: percentage of iterations in which each task appears on the critical path
- **Tornado diagram data**: ranked sensitivity items for visualization

---

## 12. Network Diagrams

### PERT / Precedence Visualization

The `NetworkDiagramService` computes a layout of the task dependency graph suitable for rendering as a precedence diagram (Activity-on-Node). Each node includes:

- Task name, duration, ES, EF, LS, LF, total float
- Critical path flag
- X/Y position coordinates for rendering

Edges connect predecessor to successor nodes with critical-path highlighting.

---

## 13. AI Features

All AI features use the Anthropic Claude SDK and are gated behind the `AI_ENABLED` environment variable. When disabled, the system operates as a fully functional non-AI PM tool.

### Auto-Reschedule

The `AutoRescheduleService` detects delayed tasks and generates reschedule proposals:

1. Identifies tasks that have slipped past their planned dates
2. Analyzes downstream impact through the dependency graph
3. Uses AI to generate proposed date changes with rationale
4. Proposals are stored for review -- users accept, reject, or provide feedback

### Natural Language Queries

The `NLQueryService` implements a multi-step AI pipeline:

1. **Tool-loop phase**: Claude gathers real data using read-only tools (list projects, get EVM metrics, get critical path, get resource workload, etc.)
2. **Structuring phase**: raw answer is formatted into structured JSON with narrative, data tables, suggested charts, and follow-up questions

Users ask questions like "Which projects are over budget?" or "Show me the critical path for Project Alpha" and receive data-backed answers.

### Meeting Intelligence

The `MeetingIntelligenceService` processes meeting transcripts or notes to extract:

- Action items with assignees and due dates
- Key decisions made
- Risk items identified
- Follow-up topics

### Lessons Learned

The `LessonsLearnedService` captures and retrieves project retrospective insights, categorized and searchable, to improve future project execution. Lessons can be edited and deleted directly from the Lessons Learned page: the edit action opens the same lesson modal pre-filled with existing values; the delete action presents a styled `ConfirmModal` before removing the record. The page supports **"Load More" pagination** so large lesson databases load incrementally rather than all at once.

### Task Prioritization

The `TaskPrioritizationService` uses AI to rank tasks based on:

- Dependency criticality
- Resource availability
- Deadline proximity
- Business impact

### Predictive Intelligence

The `predictiveIntelligence` module provides AI-driven assessments:

- **Project health scoring**: overall health grade with contributing factors
- **Risk assessment**: identified risks with probability, impact, and mitigation strategies
- **Budget forecasting**: AI-adjusted budget projections considering trends and project context
- **Dashboard predictions**: aggregated portfolio-level predictions

### Task Slip Prediction

The `predictTaskSlips()` method analyzes individual tasks to predict which are likely to slip, using deterministic scoring:

- **Overdue factor** (40%): Days past due relative to task duration
- **Progress gap** (30%): Actual vs expected progress based on elapsed time
- **Dependency factor** (20%): Incomplete predecessor count
- **Duration factor** (10%): Longer tasks carry higher inherent risk

Returns the top 20 at-risk tasks with slip probability, severity, reasons, and suggested actions. Available at `GET /api/v1/predictions/project/:projectId/task-slips`.

### Scope Creep Detector

Deterministic analysis comparing current project state against baselines:

- **Task count delta**: New tasks added since baseline
- **Estimate growth**: Cumulative duration increase across tasks
- **Change request count**: Open change requests
- **Schedule health**: Percentage of tasks on track or ahead

Severity thresholds: critical (10+ new tasks or 20+ days growth), high (5+/10+), medium (3+/5+ or 2+ change requests). Available at `GET /api/v1/predictions/project/:projectId/scope-creep`.

### AI Status Report Generator (RAG Traffic Light)

AI-powered executive status report with a Red/Amber/Green (RAG) traffic light dashboard. Claude analyzes project data and produces a structured JSON response that is rendered as styled HTML for both the UI modal and email delivery.

**Report Format:**
1. **Executive Summary** — AI-generated paragraph summarizing overall project health, key concerns, and outlook
2. **Traffic Light Dashboard** — Table with 6 areas (Schedule, Budget, Resources, Risks, Scope, Quality), each showing:
   - Previous status (from last stored report)
   - Current RAG status (🟢 Green / 🟡 Amber / 🔴 Red)
   - Trend arrow (↑ Improving / → Stable / ↓ Declining)
   - Comments explaining the assessment
3. **Actions for Management** — Numbered list of recommended management actions

**RAG Thresholds (configurable):**
- Schedule: Green = <5% tasks overdue, Amber = 5–15%, Red = >15%
- Budget: Green = <90% spent vs progress, Amber = 90–100%, Red = >100%
- Resources: Green = 0 overallocated, Amber = 1–2, Red = 3+
- Risks: Green = 0 high/critical, Amber = 1–2 high, Red = 3+ or any critical
- Scope: Green = 0 change requests, Amber = 1–2 pending, Red = 3+ or unapproved growth
- Quality: Green = <5% tasks missing data, Amber = 5–15%, Red = >15%

**Trend Computation:** Compares current RAG status against the previous report (stored in `ai_conversations` with `context_type = 'status-report'`). If current is better than previous → improving (↑), same → stable (→), worse → declining (↓).

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/status-reports/generate` — Generate a status report for a project, optionally email it to recipients
- `POST /api/v1/status-reports/schedule` — Create a recurring schedule (daily/weekly/monthly) with recipient list
- `GET /api/v1/status-reports/schedules/:projectId` — List active schedules for a project
- `DELETE /api/v1/status-reports/schedule/:id` — Delete a schedule (owner or admin only)

**MCP Tool:** `generate-status-report` — Available to project_manager, scrum_master, pmo, ba, and admin roles.

**Feature Gating:** Requires paid tier (consultant/sme/enterprise). AI generation requires `AI_ENABLED=true`; falls back to all-amber template when disabled. Email delivery requires `RESEND_API_KEY`.

### Anomaly Detection

The `anomalyDetectionService` identifies unusual patterns in project data such as sudden progress drops, budget spikes, or resource utilization anomalies.

### What-If Scenarios

The `whatIfScenarioService` allows users to model hypothetical changes (adding resources, extending deadlines, changing scope) and see projected impacts before committing.

### Cross-Project Intelligence

The `crossProjectIntelligenceService` analyzes patterns across the entire portfolio to surface systemic risks, resource conflicts, and optimization opportunities.

### Mjuzi Chat

**Mjuzi** is the AI project assistant, available as a slide-out chat panel on every page. The `aiChatService` provides a conversational interface where users can ask open-ended questions about their projects and receive AI-generated responses grounded in actual project data.

**Key features:**
- **Persistent conversations** — chat history is stored in the database (`chat_conversations` + `chat_messages` tables) and survives server restarts. Users can browse, switch between, and resume past conversations from the history panel.
- **Agent memory integration** — Mjuzi injects recent agent scan findings (via `InterAgentQueryService`), prior conversation context, and its own project-specific memories into the system prompt, enabling more informed and contextual responses.
- **Action memory** — when Mjuzi executes tools (create task, update project, etc.), it stores a memory of the action via `AgentMemoryService` for future reference.
- **Voice input** (browser Speech Recognition): users can click the mic, speak their message, and the transcript is sent as a normal chat message. Optional **text-to-speech** (“Speak replies”) reads the assistant’s replies aloud when enabled.
- **Conversation history UI** — History button and New Conversation button in the chat panel header. Click any past conversation to reload it.

### AI Reports

The `aiReportService` generates narrative project reports using AI, summarizing status, risks, and recommendations in natural language.

### Proactive Alerts

The `proactiveAlertService` continuously monitors project metrics and generates alerts when thresholds are breached (schedule slip, budget overrun, resource over-allocation).

### Agent Proposals UI

The `/agent` page (`AgentProposalsPage`) lets managers and admins review, approve/reject, execute, rollback, and rate agentic proposals. The page uses **"Load More" pagination** so only an initial batch of proposals is rendered at startup; clicking "Load More" appends the next batch, keeping the page responsive for teams with a large proposal history.

---

## 14. Reporting

### Custom Report Builder

The `ReportBuilderService` provides a configurable report engine:

- **Report templates**: saved configurations with named sections, sharable across users
- **Section types**: KPI cards, tables, bar charts, line charts, pie charts
- **Data sources**: projects, tasks, time entries, budgets
- **Filters**: date range, project, status
- **Group-by**: aggregate data by any dimension; the `groupBy` parameter is validated against an allowlist to prevent SQL injection

**Recent fixes:**
- KPI, chart, and table sections now receive correctly shaped data objects, resolving blank section renders in the report preview.
- Regular users can delete their own report templates (previously required admin role).
- The Report Designer correctly persists all configured sections when updating an existing template.

### AI-Generated Reports

The AI report endpoint generates narrative compliance and status reports using Claude, grounded in real project data.

### Portfolio Analytics

The `AnalyticsSummaryService` computes portfolio-level KPIs:

- Total projects by status
- Budget utilization across portfolio
- Resource allocation summary
- Schedule performance overview
- **On Track percentage** — displayed on the dashboard; calculated using actual schedule variance (SPI) and budget variance (CPI/budget ratio) rather than a progress threshold heuristic, so the metric accurately reflects project health

### Portfolio Dashboard

The `/api/v1/reporting/portfolio` endpoint performs server-side aggregation and returns per-project enrichment data alongside the standard project fields:

- `budgetAllocated` / `budgetSpent` — drawn from the project's budget fields
- `progressPercentage` — weighted average of task progress across all project tasks
- `totalTasks` / `completedTasks` — task count summary
- Full task detail array for client-side drill-down

The Portfolio page UI consumes this endpoint and renders a full dashboard:

- **6 KPI cards** at the top: Total Projects, Active, On Track, At Risk, Budget Allocated, Budget Spent
- **Status filter pills** — click to filter the project card grid by status (All, Active, On Hold, Planning, Completed)
- **Portfolio budget progress bar** — aggregate allocated vs. spent across all visible projects
- **Project cards** — each card shows name, status badge, health indicator, progress bar, task completion ratio, budget utilization bar, and a link to the project detail page
- **Dashboard / Timeline / Resources toggle** — switch between the KPI dashboard view, Portfolio Gantt timeline, and portfolio-wide resource view; selection persists within the session

### Portfolio Resources View

The `/api/v1/reporting/portfolio/resources` endpoint aggregates resource utilization across all active projects:

- **KPI cards**: Total Resources, Over-Allocated Count, Avg Utilization, Weekly Cost
- **Cross-project contention table**: resources assigned to 2+ projects with combined utilization > 100%, showing each project and its utilization share
- **Resource utilization table**: all resources sorted by utilization (descending), showing role, cost rate, project count, combined utilization, and project names

## 15. Notifications

### In-App Alerts

The `NotificationService` delivers notifications to users with:

- **Severity levels**: critical, high, medium, low
- **Type classification**: system, task, project, approval, alert
- **Entity linking**: link to specific project, schedule, or entity
- **Read/unread tracking**
- **WebSocket delivery**: real-time push via the `WebSocketService`
- **Bulk mark-as-read**

### Notifications Center Page

A full-page notification center is available at `/notifications`, accessible from the sidebar ("Notifications" under Workspace) and from the "View all alerts" link in the notification bell dropdown. The page provides:

- **Severity summary cards** at the top: clickable cards showing counts for Critical, High, Medium, and Low notifications. Clicking a card filters the list to that severity.
- **Filter panel**: filter by notification type (Risk, Budget, Schedule, Resource, etc.) and severity level.
- **Full notification list**: each entry shows a severity color bar, type icon, title, message, relative time ("2 hours ago"), type label, and project name.
- **Mark as read**: mark individual notifications as read (calls `apiService.markNotificationRead` so read state persists across page refreshes), or click "Mark all read" to clear all unread indicators at once.
- **Load More pagination**: a "Load More" button at the bottom of the list fetches the next page of notifications, avoiding unbounded list rendering on accounts with many notifications.
- **Data sources**: fetches both proactive alerts and persisted database notifications into a unified list.
- Uses the same severity colors and type icons as the existing notification bell dropdown for visual consistency.

### Real-Time Presence

When multiple users view the same project, avatar circles appear in the project header showing who else is currently viewing. Presence is ephemeral (in-memory on the server) and updates instantly via WebSocket. Avatars show user initials with a tooltip displaying the full username. The current user is filtered out. Up to 5 avatars are shown, with a "+N" overflow indicator for larger teams.

### Email Notifications & Digests

Critical and high-severity notifications are automatically sent via email (Resend) to users with `emailNotificationsEnabled = true` and a verified email. Users can configure a **digest frequency** (none, daily, weekly) in Settings > Notifications. The `DigestService` runs daily at 7 AM via cron and sends a summary containing:

- **Overdue tasks** assigned to the user
- **Upcoming deadlines** (next 3 days)
- **Unread notification count**

Preferences are stored in the database (`users.email_notifications_enabled`, `users.digest_frequency`, `users.digest_last_sent_at`, `users.notification_type_preferences`) and managed via `PUT /api/v1/users/me/notification-preferences`.

#### Per-Category Notification Preferences

Users can control which categories of notifications they receive, with independent toggles for in-app and email delivery:

| Category | Notification types covered |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Agent & Proposals | agent_proposal, agent_low_confidence, agent_execution_complete/failed, agent_notification, agent_rollback |
| Risks & Issues | raid_item, reschedule_proposal |
| Budget & Finance | budget_alert, ai_budget_warning, monte_carlo_alert |
| Meetings & Followups | meeting_followup |
| System Alerts | system_alert, workflow_action (always ON for admins) |
| Deadlines & Overdue | Reserved for future deadline notification types |

When a category's in-app toggle is off, notifications of that type are not inserted into the database or broadcast via WebSocket. When the email toggle is off, emails are suppressed even for critical/high severity. System alerts are never suppressed for admin users. New users (NULL preferences) default to all categories ON.

### Scheduled Report Delivery

Report templates from the Report Builder can be scheduled for automatic email delivery. Configuration is stored in the `report_schedules` table with:

- **Frequency**: daily, weekly (pick day of week), or monthly (pick day of month)
- **Time of day**: configurable delivery time
- **Recipients**: comma-separated email list
- **Format**: CSV attachment via Resend

The `ReportScheduleService` executes due schedules every 15 minutes via cron. Each execution generates the report, exports to CSV, and emails to all recipients. API endpoints at `/api/v1/report-schedules` provide full CRUD. The schedule modal is accessible via the clock icon on each report template card in the Report Builder.

---

## 16. Stakeholder Portal

### Token-Based Access

The `PortalService` generates shareable portal links with:

- Unique token per link
- Configurable permissions (read-only by default)
- Optional expiration date
- Active/inactive toggle
- Label for identification

### Public Views

Portal token holders can access without authentication:

- **Project overview and status** — name, description, status badge, and computed progress percentage (completed tasks / total tasks)
- **Budget summary** — allocated, spent, remaining, and budget usage bar (requires `canViewBudget` permission; hidden when budget is zero)
- **Timeline** — project start/end dates with days-remaining indicator (falls back to task date range when project dates are null)
- **Milestone timeline** — vertical timeline of tasks marked as milestones, color-coded by status: green (completed), blue (in-progress), gray (not started). Controlled by `canViewGantt` permission.
- **Recent activity** — last 10 completed tasks with relative timestamps (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago"). Controlled by `canViewReports` permission.
- **Task statistics** — total, not started, in-progress, and completed counts

### Stakeholder Comments

External stakeholders can submit comments on project entities through the portal, identified by author name rather than system user account. Comments are displayed in reverse chronological order with the commenter's name and timestamp. The comment form includes name and message fields with dark mode support. Comments are scoped per portal link — two links to the same project maintain separate comment threads.

### Portal Security

**Server-side permission enforcement:** The backend filters the API response based on the token's permissions. When a permission is denied, the data is never queried or returned — not just hidden on the client:

- `canViewBudget: false` → `budgetAllocated` and `budgetSpent` return as 0
- `canViewGantt: false` → `milestones` array is empty (query skipped)
- `canViewReports: false` → `recentActivity` array is empty (query skipped)
- `canComment: false` → `comments` array is empty; `POST /view/:token/comment` returns HTTP 403

**Input sanitization:** Comment `authorName` and `content` are stripped of HTML tags before storage to prevent stored XSS.

**Project-level access control:** All authenticated portal management routes (`POST /links`, `GET /links`, `PUT /links/:id`, `DELETE /links/:id`, `GET /comments`) enforce project membership via `requireProjectAccess`. Admin and PMO roles bypass this check; executives get read-only access.

**Comment pagination:** `findComments()` defaults to a limit of 100 results to prevent unbounded queries.

---

## 17. Intake Forms

### Dynamic Form Builder

The `IntakeFormService` supports creating intake forms with configurable fields:

- Field types: text, number, date, select, checkbox, textarea
- Required/optional validation
- Dropdown option lists
- Active/inactive form status

### Submission Tracking

Submissions flow through a review pipeline:

- Submitted -> Under Review -> Approved / Rejected
- Reviewer assignment and notes
- Conversion to project: approved submissions can be automatically converted into new projects

---

## 18. Templates

### Project Templates

The `TemplateService` allows saving a project's structure as a reusable template:

- Template name, description, category
- Serialized project configuration (tasks, phases, dependencies, custom fields)
- Shared or private visibility
- Apply a template to create a new project with pre-populated structure

---

## 19. Integrations

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Adapter | Capabilities |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Jira** | `JiraAdapter` | Bi-directional task sync, status mapping |
| **GitHub** | `GitHubAdapter` | Issue sync, PR status tracking |
| **Slack** | `SlackAdapter` | Notification delivery, channel updates |
| **Trello** | `TrelloAdapter` | Card sync, board mapping |

### Webhooks

The `WebhookService` allows registering outbound webhook endpoints that fire on configurable events (task created, status changed, project updated, etc.). Each delivery is logged with status and retry support.

### Integration Management

- Per-project or global integration configuration
- Credential storage in encrypted config blobs
- Sync logging with direction (inbound/outbound), item counts, and error tracking
- Last-sync timestamp for monitoring
- Destructive actions (delete integration, delete webhook, revoke API key, delete change request, delete intake form, delete report template, delete goal) use a reusable `ConfirmModal` component instead of the browser's native `window.confirm()`, providing a consistent, styled confirmation dialog that respects the application's dark mode and design system

---

## 20. Security

### Authentication

- **JWT tokens**: issued on login, stored in HttpOnly cookies with configurable expiration
- **Password hashing**: bcrypt with configurable salt rounds
- **Registration**: username, email, password, full name
- **Password reset**: token-based email flow via `EmailService`
- **Session management**: refresh token rotation
- **OAuth 2.1**: PKCE-based authorization for MCP HTTP transport (per-user access from Claude Desktop/Web)

### Roles

Six user roles with hierarchical permissions:

| Role | Scopes | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `admin` | read, write, admin | Full system access |
| `executive` | read | Portfolio oversight + approval authority |
| `project_manager` | read, write | Full project lifecycle management |
| `scrum_master` | read, write | Sprint and task management |
| `team_member` | read | Task work + time logging |
| `finance_officer` | read | Budget and financial visibility |

MCP tools are filtered by role — agents only see tools their role permits (see `mcp-server/src/permissions.ts`).

### API Keys

The `ApiKeyService` issues scoped API keys for programmatic access:

- Scope-based permissions (read, write, admin)
- **Role resolution**: API key auth resolves the user's actual database role (not inferred from scopes)
- Key hashing (only prefix stored in plaintext for identification)
- Expiration support
- Revocation

### Audit Ledger (Hash-Chain)

The `AuditLedgerService` maintains a tamper-evident append-only log:

- Every entry references the previous entry's SHA-256 hash, forming a hash chain
- Entries record: actor (user/api_key/system), action, entity type/ID, project, payload, source (web/mcp/api/system), IP address, session
- Chain integrity can be verified at any time
- Filterable by project, entity, actor, action, date range

### Policy Engine

The `PolicyEngineService` enforces configurable governance rules:

- **Action patterns**: match against specific operations (e.g., `task.delete`, `budget.update`)
- **Condition expressions**: field-based conditions with operators (>, <, ==, !=, in, contains, etc.)
- **Enforcement levels**: log_only, require_approval, block
- **Evaluation logging**: every policy evaluation is recorded with context snapshot
- Project-scoped or global policies

### AI Token Budget

The `AIBudgetService` enforces per-user monthly AI token limits with tier-aware budget resolution:

- **Per-tier defaults**: Trial — 25,000 tokens/mo; Consultant — 500,000; SME — 1,500,000; Enterprise — 5,000,000. Configurable via `AI_TIER_BUDGET_TRIAL`, `AI_TIER_BUDGET_CONSULTANT`, `AI_TIER_BUDGET_SME`, `AI_TIER_BUDGET_ENTERPRISE` env vars.
- **Budget resolution chain**: per-user override (`users.ai_monthly_token_budget`) → subscription tier default → global fallback (`AI_MONTHLY_TOKEN_BUDGET`)
- **Token top-ups**: Users can purchase additional token packs ($5 per 500K tokens) via Stripe one-time payment. Top-up tokens are added instantly, do not expire, and are consumed only after the monthly tier allowance is exhausted. FIFO consumption (oldest packs first). Managed by `TokenTopUpRepository`.
- Tracks all AI usage in the `ai_usage_log` table (input/output tokens, cost, latency, feature, model)
- Budget checked before every AI call in `claudeService` — throws `AIBudgetExceededError` (HTTP 429) with `code: 'AI_BUDGET_EXCEEDED'`, `resetDate`, `used`, and `budget` fields when exceeded
- **Graceful degradation**: When the budget is exhausted, AI features are blocked but all non-AI features (scheduling, task management, reporting, collaboration) remain fully operational. The Mjuzi chat displays an actionable message with the reset date and a link to purchase more tokens.
- **80% threshold warning**: When usage reaches 80%, a daily-deduped `ai_budget_warning` notification is automatically created (severity: high) informing the user of tokens remaining and days left in the month
- **Circuit breaker**: After 5 consecutive transient failures (rate limit, timeout, API overload), the AI circuit breaker opens and returns HTTP 503 immediately for 60 seconds instead of making doomed API calls. Recovers automatically after cooldown.
- `GET /api/v1/ai/budget` returns current month's usage summary: `totalInputTokens`, `totalOutputTokens`, `totalTokens`, `totalCost`, `requestCount`, `budget`, `remaining`, `percentUsed`
- **Admin override**: Admins can set per-user custom budgets via `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/:id/budget`. The Admin Users page shows an inline-editable "AI Budget" column — set a custom value or clear to use tier default.

### Prompt Injection Mitigation

Defense-in-depth protection against prompt injection in AI-powered features. User-supplied data (project names, descriptions, task names, meeting notes) is sanitized before interpolation into system prompts:

- **Input sanitization** (`sanitizeForPrompt()`): Strips template markers (`{{`, `}}`), common injection phrases (`SYSTEM:`, `ignore previous instructions`, `Human:`/`Assistant:`, etc.), and truncates excessively long inputs (default 50,000 chars)
- **Structural delimiters**: `PromptTemplate.render()` wraps all interpolated values in `<user-data field="...">` XML tags, establishing a clear boundary between instructions and data
- **Defense preamble**: `buildSystemPrompt()` prepends an instruction telling the model to treat `<user-data>` content strictly as data to analyze, never as instructions to follow
- **Coverage**: Applied to all template-rendered prompts (task breakdown, risk assessment, project insights, reports, meeting notes, conversational), context builder output (project names, descriptions), and quality agent prompts (scope, hygiene, lessons)
- **Chat messages**: User chat input is sent as the Anthropic `user` role message (not interpolated into system prompts), which is the architecturally correct position for untrusted input

### Security Middleware

- Content Security Policy (CSP) via Helmet
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- CORS protection with environment-aware origins
- Input validation via Zod schemas on all routes (24 route files validated)
- Scope-based route protection via `requireScope` middleware

---

## 21. MCP Server

### Overview

A standalone Model Context Protocol (MCP) server (`mcp-server/server.ts`) enables Claude Desktop and Claude Web to interact with PM Assistant directly. It communicates over stdio transport and authenticates via API key.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list-projects` | List all projects |
| `get-project` | Get project details by ID |
| `get-schedules` | Get all schedules for a project |
| `get-tasks` | Get all tasks in a schedule |
| `get-project-health` | AI health score for a project |
| `get-project-risks` | AI risk assessment for a project |
| `get-project-budget` | AI budget forecast for a project |
| `get-spend-to-date` | Cumulative project spending with earned value and variance |
| `get-burn-rate` | Daily/monthly spending rate with EVM cost metrics |
| `get-analytics` | Portfolio-level analytics summary |
| `get-alerts` | Proactive alerts across all projects |
| `search` | Search projects and tasks by keyword |
| `get-portfolio` | Full portfolio overview |
| `suggest-risk-mitigations` | AI risk mitigation suggestions from historical lessons |
| `get-meeting-summary` | Extract summary, actions, and decisions from meeting transcript |

### MCP Proxy

The main application also exposes an `/mcp` reverse proxy route for HTTP-based MCP transport, allowing browser-based Claude integrations to connect through the production domain.

---

## 22. Billing

### Stripe Integration

The `StripeService` manages subscription billing:

- **Customer creation**: linked to user accounts
- **Multi-tier checkout**: Consultant ($19/mo or $190/yr), SME ($39/mo or $390/yr), Enterprise ($79/mo or $790/yr). Price IDs configured via `STRIPE_CONSULTANT_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_SME_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` (and annual variants).
- **Token top-up checkout**: One-time payment for 500K token packs ($5 each, 1-20 packs per purchase). Price ID via `STRIPE_TOPUP_PRICE_ID`. Webhook prevents double-processing via `findByStripeSession()`.
- **Billing portal**: self-service subscription management via Stripe's portal
- **Webhook handling**: processes Stripe events for subscription lifecycle (created, updated, cancelled, payment succeeded/failed) and top-up completion. Every event is written to the `subscription_events` table and logged to the audit ledger.
- **Tier resolution**: `resolveTierFromPriceId()` maps Stripe price IDs to app tiers (trial, consultant, sme, enterprise) with legacy fallback support
- **Revenue capture**: `amount_cents`, `currency`, and `billing_interval` are extracted from Stripe webhook payloads and stored on the `subscriptions` row so revenue figures are always queryable without a Stripe API call.

### Subscription Events

Every subscription lifecycle change is persisted to the `subscription_events` table:

- **Event types**: `tier_change`, `cancellation`, `renewal`, `payment_failure`, `topup_purchase`, `trial_started`, `trial_converted`
- **Revenue data**: `amount_cents` and `currency` recorded for all payment events
- **Deduplication**: `stripe_event_id` prevents double-writes on webhook retries
- Powers the Admin Revenue Dashboard and the per-user subscription event history modal

### Account Billing Page

The `AccountBillingPage` (`/account/billing`) shows:

- **Plan name**: dynamically resolved from the user's actual subscription tier — never hardcoded. Trial tier shows "Trial Plan", paid tiers show "Consultant Plan", "SME Plan", or "Enterprise Plan" accordingly.
- **Top-up balance**: remaining purchased token balance with a **Buy More** button linking to the token top-up Stripe checkout.
- **AI usage meter**: progress bar showing current-month token consumption vs the effective budget (tier allowance + top-up balance), color-coded green/amber/red.

### Viewer Invite Flow

Paid subscribers (Consultant, SME, and Enterprise tiers) can invite external client stakeholders as **viewer accounts** — free, read-only users who do not consume a paid seat.

**Invite limits by tier:**

| Tier | Viewer Invites |
|------|---------------|
| Trial | 0 (not available) |
| Consultant | 5 |
| SME | 20 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

**What viewers can do:**
- View any project they have been explicitly invited to (project name, status, progress, milestones, budget summary)
- Update RAID items where they are listed as the owner (status transitions only — the `viewer` user role restricts write access to owned RAID items exclusively)

**What viewers cannot do:**
- Create or delete projects, tasks, or any other entities
- Access projects they have not been invited to
- Access administrative settings, reports, API keys, or billing

**Invite flow:**
1. A paid user navigates to **Settings → Viewer Invites** (or the project's Members tab).
2. They enter the invitee's email address and select one or more projects to share.
3. The system checks the inviting user's remaining invite quota. If the quota is exhausted, the invite is blocked with a clear upgrade prompt.
4. An invitation email is sent to the invitee. If the email does not match an existing account, a viewer account is auto-provisioned on first acceptance.
5. The invitee clicks the link, completes registration (password only — no billing), and lands on a read-only project view.
6. The inviting user can revoke access at any time from their invite management panel.

**Role:** Invited viewers receive the `viewer` system role. This role has read scope only, plus the ability to update RAID items they own (see Section 45 for RAID role-based permissions).

### Trial Reminder Emails

The `EmailService` sends automated reminder emails to users approaching the end of their 14-day free trial:

| Days Before Expiry | Email Sent |
|--------------------|------------|
| 3 days | "Your trial ends in 3 days" reminder |
| 1 day | "Your trial ends tomorrow" reminder |
| 0 days (expiry day) | "Your trial has expired" notice |

A daily cron job runs at **09:00** to scan for trials expiring within the relevant windows and dispatch the appropriate email. Redis-backed deduplication prevents the same reminder from being sent more than once per user per trigger window — if the cron runs multiple times or a user is picked up on consecutive days for the same window, only one email is delivered.

### Pricing Page

The Pricing page (`/pricing`) presents three paid tiers (Consultant, SME, Enterprise) with monthly/annual billing toggle and a 17%-save badge on annual plans. Each plan card shows:

- Price and billing period
- AI token allowance with **practical usage equivalents** (e.g., "~100 AI chats, 50 risk scans, or 25 reports/mo") so users understand what their token budget means in real terms
- Feature list with checkmarks
- Subscribe / Switch Plan / Current Plan button (context-aware based on auth state and current tier)

Below the plan cards, a **Feature Comparison Matrix** provides a side-by-side table across all 4 tiers (Trial, Consultant, SME, Enterprise). Features are marked with checkmarks (included), X marks (excluded), or text values (e.g., "3", "1GB", "Unlimited"). The table covers projects, AI tokens, exports, API access, EVM, Monte Carlo, resource management, workflows, portal, intelligence features, meeting tools, MCP, storage, and top-ups.

| Feature | Trial | Consultant | SME | Enterprise |
|---------|-------|------------|-----|------------|
| Projects | 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| AI Tokens/mo | 25K | 500K | 1.5M | 5M |
| Storage | 100MB | 1GB | 5GB | 10GB |
| Viewer Invites | 0 | 5 | 20 | Unlimited |
| Exports | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| API Keys | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| EVM | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Monte Carlo | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Auto-Reschedule | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Resource Management | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Custom Reports | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| DAG Workflows | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Portal Management | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Meeting Intelligence | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| NL Query | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cross-Project Intelligence | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Token Top-Ups | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Price (monthly) | Free | $19/mo | $39/mo | $79/mo |
| Price (annual) | Free | $190/yr | $390/yr | $790/yr |

A **Token Top-Up CTA** below the comparison table lets users purchase additional token packs ($5 per 500K).

**Checkout Error Display:** When a Stripe Checkout session fails to initialize (network error, invalid price ID, Stripe API error), the Pricing page displays an **inline error banner** in a styled red alert box.

### Feature Gating

Trial users have access to core project management features only. The following features are restricted to paid tiers (Consultant, SME, Enterprise):

| Restricted Feature | Trial | Paid Tiers |
|--------------------|-------|------------|
| Exports (CSV, PDF, XML) | ✗ | ✓ |
| API Keys | ✗ | ✓ |
| Earned Value Management (EVM) | ✗ | ✓ |
| Monte Carlo Simulation | ✗ | ✓ |
| Auto-Reschedule | ✗ | ✓ |
| Resource Management | ✗ | ✓ |
| Custom Report Builder | ✗ | ✓ |
| DAG Workflow Automation | ✗ | ✓ |
| Stakeholder Portal Management | ✗ | ✓ |
| Meeting Intelligence | ✗ | ✓ |
| Natural Language Query | ✗ | ✓ |
| Cross-Project Intelligence | ✗ | ✓ |
| Token Top-Ups | ✗ | ✓ |
| Viewer Invites | ✗ | ✓ |

When a trial user attempts to access a gated feature, they are shown an **upgrade prompt** with a direct link to the Pricing page. Gating is enforced server-side — restricted API endpoints return HTTP 403 with `code: 'FEATURE_GATED'` for trial accounts. Client-side gating provides an early prompt but is not the security boundary.

---

## 23. Dashboard

All users see a single dashboard (`DashboardPM` via `DashboardRouter`) instead of the previous role-based dashboards. The dashboard is customizable per-user via a **Customize** dropdown that toggles widget sections on/off, with selections persisted in `localStorage`.

### Scope Toggle

When a user's own projects are a subset of the full portfolio (e.g., a `team_member` vs an `admin`), a **My Projects / All Projects** toggle appears in the header. Switching scope updates KPI tiles, the projects table, issues trend chart, milestones, and budget watch. The selected scope persists in `localStorage`.

### Widget Sections

| Widget | Description |
|---|---|
| **KPI Tiles** | 6 tiles: Portfolio Health, Overdue Tasks, Open Risks, At-Risk Projects, Budget Variance, Budget Utilization. Health and Overdue tiles show 7-day trend arrows (improving/declining/stable) computed from `AnalyticsSummaryService.trendIndicators`. |
| **Portfolio Intelligence** | AI-generated health score, risk summary, budget status, key insights, and optional AI narrative |
| **Projects Table** | Sortable table with health score column (colored dot + numeric), status, priority, progress, budget, end date |
| **Issues Trend** | SVG line chart showing issues created vs resolved per week (8-week window), with net change badge |
| **Milestones** | Upcoming milestones with project name, date, and days-until badge (green/red) |
| **Budget Watch** | Top 5 projects by spend percentage with progress bars |
| **Recent Activity** | Latest notifications feed with filter pills (All / Agent / Risk / Budget / Meeting / System) and date grouping (Today / Yesterday / Earlier). Click any notification to navigate to the linked entity and mark it as read. "View All" link navigates to the full notifications page. |
| **Next Best Actions** | AI-suggested next actions with confidence percentage badges (blue pill), risk level badges (color-coded: critical/high/medium/low), and health score badges for at-risk projects. Low-confidence proposals (<60%) are bumped in priority for human review. Critical-severity notifications now surface alongside high-severity. |
| **Health Trends** | Sparkline health history per project |
| **Sprint Snapshot** | Active sprints across projects with day progress, task completion bar, and velocity trend (default: off) |
| **Goals** | Objectives sorted by urgency with progress bars, status badges, and due dates. "View All" links to the Goals page (default: off) |
| **Team Workload** | Per-resource task counts with horizontal bars and overload indicator for resources with 15+ tasks (default: off) |

### Backend Endpoints

Three new endpoints under `GET /api/v1/dashboard/`:
- **`/overdue-tasks`** — Tasks past due date, ordered by overdue days (limit 50)
- **`/issues-trend`** — Created vs resolved task counts per week bucket (fills empty weeks with zeros)
- **`/milestones`** — Upcoming milestones within 7 days past to future

All three support `?scope=portfolio` to bypass user filtering. Global roles (`admin`, `executive`, `pmo`) see all projects by default.

Additionally, `GET /api/v1/projects` and `GET /api/v1/analytics/summary` now accept `?scope=portfolio` to return unfiltered results regardless of user role.

---

## 24. Mobile-Optimized Views

The application includes mobile-optimized layouts that activate automatically on screens narrower than 768px (the `useBreakpoint()` hook, shared across all pages).

### Landing Page Mobile Navigation

On the public landing page, the horizontal navigation link row is replaced by a **hamburger menu** on mobile viewports (below 768px). Tapping the hamburger icon opens a vertical nav overlay with the same links. This prevents the nav from wrapping or overflowing on small screens.

### Bottom Navigation Bar

A fixed bottom navigation bar (`BottomNav`) replaces the sidebar on mobile, providing quick access to:
- Dashboard, Projects, Timesheet, Notifications, and More (opens sidebar overlay)

The main content area receives bottom padding (`pb-20`) to prevent overlap with the bottom nav.

### Mobile Task Cards

The `TaskCardMobile` component displays tasks in a touch-friendly card format with:
- Task name, status pill, priority badge, assignee, and due date
- Quick status cycle button (tap to advance: pending -> in_progress -> completed)
- Comfortable tap targets (min 56px height)

The `TaskListMobile` component wraps multiple cards with filter chips (status filter, "My Tasks" toggle).

### Mobile Schedule View

On mobile, the project Schedule tab automatically renders `TaskListMobile` instead of the Gantt/Kanban/Table/Calendar view toggle, providing a scrollable card-based task list.

### Mobile Timesheet

On mobile, the timesheet displays a card-per-day layout instead of the grid table. Each card shows the date, total hours, and a compact entry list. Week navigation is preserved.

### Mobile-Responsive Gantt (Touch Gestures)

Touch support is added to all Gantt chart drag interactions, enabling full use on tablets and touch-enabled laptops:

- **Bar drag (move/resize)**: `touchstart` on a task bar initiates the drag, `touchmove` updates the bar position in real time, and `touchend` commits the date change. Works for both moving (whole bar) and resizing (right edge).
- **Progress drag**: touch-drag the progress handle within a task bar to adjust the completion percentage.
- **Drag-to-create**: touch-drag on an empty timeline area to create a new task with pre-filled dates, mirroring the mouse-based drag-to-create behavior.
- Touch events use `touch.clientX` / `touch.clientY` to mirror existing mouse handler logic.
- `preventDefault` is called on `touchmove` to prevent page scrolling while a drag operation is in progress.
- Only single-finger gestures are recognized; multi-touch is ignored.

## 25. Dark Mode

A global dark theme is available throughout the application. The user toggles it via the **dark mode button** in the TopBar. The selected theme is persisted in `themeStore` (localStorage) and applied immediately by adding the `dark` class to the root `<html>` element. All UI components and pages use Tailwind `dark:` variant classes so colours, borders, and backgrounds switch automatically.

**Full coverage:** Every page in the application has `dark:` companion classes — including all auth pages (Login, Register, Forgot/Reset Password, Verify Email), public pages (Landing, Pricing, Privacy, Terms), dashboard pages (Executive, Portfolio, Analytics), tool pages (Report Builder, Workflow, Monte Carlo, Scenario Modeling), admin pages, and all shared components (report designer/preview, lessons cards, task form modal, notification bell, time tracking, custom fields, attachments, templates, timesheet grid, etc.).

---

## 26. Project Milestones

Any task can be marked as a milestone by setting `is_milestone = true`. Milestone tasks render as **diamonds** on the Gantt chart (zero-width diamond icon centred on the task date) rather than as horizontal bars. Milestones are still full tasks — they carry status, assignee, and dependency information — but conventionally have zero estimated duration.

---

## 27. Multi-Dependency Support

Each task supports up to **20 predecessors**. Dependencies are stored in a `task_dependencies` junction table (with `ON DELETE CASCADE`) rather than columns on the task row, allowing any number of predecessors per task.

### Dependency Types and Lag

Each individual predecessor relationship carries its own type and optional lag:

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **FS** (Finish-to-Start) | Successor starts after predecessor finishes (default) |
| **FF** (Finish-to-Finish) | Successor finishes no earlier than predecessor finishes |
| **SS** (Start-to-Start) | Successor starts no earlier than predecessor starts |
| **SF** (Start-to-Finish) | Successor finishes after predecessor starts |

An optional **lag** (positive integer, days) can be added to any individual dependency to introduce a waiting period. Negative lag (lead time) is also supported. CPM forward/backward pass calculations respect all four types and lag values across all predecessors, taking the maximum constraint when a task has multiple predecessors.

### API Payload

On task create and update, pass a `dependencies` array. Each entry has:

```json
{ "dependencyId": "<taskId>", "dependencyType": "FS", "lagDays": 0 }
```

Omitting `dependencies` leaves existing dependencies unchanged. Passing an empty array `[]` clears all predecessors.

### Predecessor Display Format

Multiple predecessors are displayed as a comma-separated list in compact **row-number notation** matching MS Project conventions:

| Display | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `3` | Finish-to-Start dependency on row 3 (FS is default, omitted for brevity) |
| `7SS` | Start-to-Start dependency on row 7 |
| `3FS+2d` | Finish-to-Start on row 3 with 2-day lag |
| `12FF-1d` | Finish-to-Finish on row 12 with 1-day negative lag (lead) |
| `3FS+2d,5SS,7` | Three predecessors on rows 3, 5, and 7 |

This format is also used in CSV export, matching MS Project's export convention.

### Dependency Health Badges

Each predecessor in the list displays a colour-coded health dot indicating that predecessor's status:

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Green | Predecessor is **completed** — dependency satisfied |
| Yellow | Predecessor is **in progress** — being worked on |
| Red | Predecessor is **overdue** — not completed and past its end date |

Health badges appear in the Table view Predecessor column, the Gantt left panel Pred column, and Gantt bar tooltips. Dependency arrows on the Gantt chart are drawn for each predecessor and colour-coded by health status (green, yellow, or red).

### Interactive Dependency Drawing (Gantt)

In the Gantt chart, dependencies can be created visually by dragging between task bars — matching the MS Project interaction model:

1. **Hover over a task bar** to reveal two small connector dots at the left (start) and right (finish) edges.
2. **Click and drag** from a connector dot toward another task bar. A dashed blue preview line follows the cursor.
3. **Release** over the target task bar. The target edge (start or finish) is determined by which half of the bar the cursor lands on (left half = start, right half = finish).
4. The dependency type is inferred from the source and target edges: finish→start = FS, start→start = SS, finish→finish = FF, start→finish = SF.

Validation rules apply: no self-references, no duplicates, max 20 predecessors, and parent/summary tasks are excluded. The target row highlights in blue while dragging over it.

### Inline Predecessor Editing

In Table view, the Predecessor column is inline-editable. Click a predecessor cell and type one or more predecessor entries separated by commas (e.g. `3`, `5SS`, `7FS+2d`, `3FS+2d,5SS,7`). The input is validated: invalid row numbers, self-references, duplicate entries, and malformed formats display a red error border with a message. Clearing the field removes all dependencies.

### Task Form Modal

The task form modal shows a multi-predecessor UI: a list of dependency rows, each with a predecessor selector, dependency type dropdown (FS/SS/FF/SF), and lag-days field. Use the **Add Predecessor** button to append a new row (up to the 20-predecessor limit) and the remove button on each row to delete it.

### Server-Side Dependency Validation

All dependency writes — API, UI, and AI tools — go through `validateDependency()` on the server for each dependency entry. The server is the single source of truth; no client-side pre-flight checks are needed. The following rules are enforced per dependency, returning HTTP 400 on violation:

| Rule | Error Message |
|------|---------------|
| **Self-reference** — a task cannot depend on itself | "A task cannot depend on itself" |
| **Nonexistent dependency** — the referenced task must exist | "Dependency task '{id}' not found" |
| **Cross-schedule** — both tasks must be in the same schedule | "Dependency must be in the same schedule" |
| **Circular dependency** — the dependency must not create a cycle (A→B→C→A) | "Circular dependency detected: the dependency task is already downstream of this task" |
| **Limit exceeded** — tasks may not have more than 20 predecessors | "A task cannot have more than 20 predecessors" |

**Orphan cleanup:** When a task is deleted, its row in `task_dependencies` is removed by `ON DELETE CASCADE` for both the predecessor and successor sides, so no dangling references remain.

---

## 28. Kanban WIP Limits

Each status column on the Kanban board can have a **Work-In-Progress (WIP) limit**. When a column's task count reaches the configured limit, the column header turns amber and further drops are visually flagged. WIP limits are set per-column from the Kanban toolbar and stored in `localStorage`. A limit of `0` means unlimited.

---

## 29. Comment @Mentions

When writing a task comment, typing `@` opens an autocomplete dropdown listing project members. Selecting a username inserts the mention token into the comment. When the comment is saved, the `NotificationService` creates an in-app notification for every mentioned user, linking back to the task.

---

## 30. Bulk Import (CSV / Excel)

Tasks can be imported in bulk from a CSV or Excel file via `POST /api/v1/schedules/:id/import`. The UI provides:

1. **Upload or paste** — drag-and-drop a `.csv`, `.xlsx`, or `.xls` file (max 5MB) or paste raw CSV text.
2. **Sheet selection** — for multi-sheet Excel files, a dropdown lets you choose which sheet to import.
3. **Column mapping** — map columns to task fields (name, start date, end date, estimated days, status, priority, assignee).
4. **Preview** — inspect the parsed rows before committing.
5. **Import** — valid rows are created as tasks via `scheduleService.createTask()` (with full dependency validation, audit logging, workflow triggers, sort order management, and WebSocket broadcasts); errors are reported per-row.

**Guardrails:**
- **Schedule validation** — the target schedule must exist (404 otherwise).
- **Duplicate detection** — rows with the same name + start date as an existing task (or earlier row in the same batch) are skipped.
- **File size limit** — 5MB enforced both client-side (before upload) and server-side (before parsing).
- **Row limit** — maximum 100 rows per import.

---

## 31. Gantt PDF Export

A **Print / Export PDF** button in the schedule toolbar calls `window.print()` with a print-optimised CSS stylesheet applied. The Gantt chart expands to show all tasks, hides navigation chrome, and formats page breaks appropriately. The result is a print-ready PDF when saved from the browser's print dialog.

---

## 32. Gantt Quick Search, Filter Panel & Saved Views

### Quick Search (Ctrl+F)

A **search bar** in the Gantt toolbar provides instant type-ahead filtering on task names. Press **Ctrl+F** to focus the search input. Typing filters the task list to show only tasks whose name contains the search term (case-insensitive substring match). Parent rows remain visible when any of their children match, preserving hierarchy context. A counter displays **"X / total tasks"** to indicate how many tasks match the current filter. Press **Escape** to clear the search and restore the full task list.

### Filter Panel

Click the **Filter** button (funnel icon) in the Gantt toolbar to open a collapsible filter panel. Available filters:

- **Status** — Multi-select checkboxes (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled).
- **Priority** — Multi-select checkboxes (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
- **Assignee** — Free-text search to filter by assignee name.
- **Date Range** — "Start After" and "Start Before" date pickers to narrow tasks by their start date.
- **Progress Range** — Min and Max percentage sliders/inputs to filter by completion percentage.

All active filters are combined with **AND** logic — a task must satisfy every filter to appear. Parent rows remain visible when any descendant matches, maintaining the hierarchy. An **active filter count badge** appears on the Filter button showing how many filters are currently applied. A **"Clear All"** button inside the panel resets every filter at once.

### Saved Views

The existing **SavedViewsDropdown** component is wired into the Gantt toolbar. It allows users to save and load named view configurations that capture:

- **Visible columns** — which left-panel columns are shown or hidden.
- **Sort field and direction** — the active column sort (ascending, descending, or none).
- **Zoom level** — the selected timescale (Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year).

Saved views are stored in **localStorage** with a `gantt:` prefix to keep them separate from Table view configurations. Select a saved view from the dropdown to instantly restore its settings; create new views or delete existing ones from the same dropdown.

---

## 33. Gantt Row Striping, Resource Avatars & Drag-to-Create

Three visual and interaction enhancements to the Gantt chart:

### Row Striping

Alternating row backgrounds (every other row) in both the left task panel and the timeline provide visual separation for improved readability. The stripe uses a subtle `bg-gray-50/60` with `dark:bg-gray-800/30` for dark mode support. Active task highlights, hover states, and row drag indicators all override the stripe color.

### Resource Avatars

Task bars display a small 18px circle at the right edge showing the assignee's initials. The background colour is deterministic — each name hashes to one of 10 palette colours, so the same person always gets the same colour across all tasks. Avatars appear on non-parent, non-milestone bars wider than 40px. The bar label text automatically adds right padding when an avatar is present to prevent overlap. Hover over the avatar to see the full assignee name in a tooltip.

### Drag-to-Create

Click and drag on an empty area of the Gantt timeline to create a new task with pre-filled dates. While dragging, a dashed blue preview rectangle shows the selected date range. On mouse-up, the Add Task form opens with start/end dates computed from the drag span. Parent task detection is automatic:

- Dragging on a **parent task row** creates a child of that parent.
- Dragging on a **child task row** creates a sibling (same parent).
- Dragging on a **top-level task row** creates a new top-level task.

A minimum drag width of half a day (`0.5 × dayPx`) prevents accidental task creation. The crosshair cursor indicates that drag-to-create is available. Bar cursors (grab/grabbing) override the crosshair on hover.

---

## 34. Gantt Resource Overallocation Warnings

A toggle button labelled **"Overalloc"** (with a warning triangle icon) in the Gantt toolbar enables client-side detection of resource overallocation. When enabled:

- The system groups all tasks by their `assignedTo` field and identifies date overlaps — i.e., where the same person is assigned to two or more tasks whose date ranges overlap.
- Overallocated task bars receive an **amber highlight** — a 2px amber border with a glow effect — plus a small amber **"!" warning dot** on the bar.
- A **badge with count** appears on the toolbar button showing how many bars are currently flagged.
- The Gantt **legend** includes an entry showing an amber-bordered box labelled "Overallocated".

Detection is entirely client-side (no server API required). Toggle the button off to hide all overallocation highlights.

---

## 35. Gantt Minimap

A **200×80px overview panel** in the bottom-right corner of the Gantt timeline provides a bird's-eye view of the entire schedule. Toggle it with the **"Map"** button (map icon) in the toolbar. The minimap is enabled by default.

- Each task bar is represented as a small coloured rectangle matching its status colour (blue for in progress, green for completed, grey for pending).
- A **semi-transparent blue viewport rectangle** shows the currently visible portion of the timeline and tracks scroll position in real time.
- **Click** anywhere on the minimap to jump the timeline to that position.
- **Drag** the viewport rectangle to scroll the timeline proportionally.

Toggle the button off to hide the minimap panel.

---

## 36. MS Project XML Export (MSPDI)

PM Assistant can export a project as an **MSPDI XML file** compatible with Microsoft Project and ProjectLibre.

**Server endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/exports/projects/:id/export?format=xml`

The generated XML includes:

- **Project metadata** — project name, start date, and a standard calendar definition (weekdays Mon–Fri).
- **Tasks** — each task includes UID, Name, WBS, OutlineLevel, Start, Finish, Duration (formatted as `PT{days×8}H0M0S`), Milestone flag, Summary flag, PercentComplete, and PredecessorLink elements for each dependency.
- **Resources** — extracted from the `assignedTo` field of all tasks, deduplicated.
- **Assignments** — task-to-resource mappings linking each task to its assigned resource.

**Dependency mapping:** FS = type 1, FF = type 0, SS = type 2, SF = type 3. Lag is expressed in tenths-of-minutes.

**Client access:** The API client exposes `exportProjectXML(projectId)`. On the **Project Detail** page, an **"Export XML"** button appears in the same action row as Export CSV and Export PDF.

---

## 37. Goals / OKR Tracking

The Goals module provides Objectives and Key Results (OKR) tracking alongside traditional project scheduling.

- **Objectives** — High-level goals with a title, description, owner, and time period.
- **Key Results** — Measurable outcomes nested under an objective, each with a numeric target, current value, and unit.
- **Progress** — Automatically calculated from key result completion percentages.
- **Project linking** — OKRs can be associated with a project using a searchable project dropdown in the goal modal (replaces the previous free-text Project ID field), preventing invalid IDs and improving discoverability.

**API endpoints:** `GET/POST /api/v1/goals`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/goals/:id`.

---

## 38. Time Zone Support

Each user can set a preferred timezone in **Settings → Preferences** (stored via `PUT /api/v1/users/me/preferences`). All date and time values rendered in the UI are converted to the user's timezone using the stored IANA timezone string (e.g., `America/Toronto`). Server timestamps remain in UTC; conversion happens client-side. When no preference is set the browser's local timezone is used as a fallback.

---

## 39. Multi-Language (i18n)

The frontend supports **English (en)**, **French (fr)**, and **Spanish (es)**. The active locale is managed by `localeStore` (Zustand, persisted in localStorage) and consumed via the `useTranslation()` hook. All user-facing strings are keyed through the translation map; switching locale applies immediately without a page reload. The locale can be changed from **Settings → Language**.

---

## 40. Accessibility + Adaptive UI

### Accessibility Preferences
Users can configure accessibility settings from **Settings → Accessibility**:
- **High Contrast**: Increases border widths and color contrast for improved readability
- **Font Size** (12–24px): Adjusts the base font size across the entire application via CSS custom property `--app-font-size`
- **Reduced Motion**: Disables all CSS animations and transitions
- **Text Simplification** (off/mild/strong): AI-powered simplification of narratives and reports
- **AI Narration**: Toggle dashboard narrative summaries on/off

Preferences are stored server-side in the `accessibility_preferences` JSON column (migration 034) and cached in localStorage. The `AccessibilityProvider` React context applies CSS classes (`high-contrast`, `reduce-motion`) to the document root.

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/users/me/accessibility` — get current preferences
- `PUT /api/v1/users/me/accessibility` — update preferences
- `POST /api/v1/accessibility/simplify` — simplify text (body: `{ text, level }`)
- `POST /api/v1/accessibility/reading-level` — analyze reading level (returns Flesch-Kincaid score, grade, and level)

### Reading Level Analysis
Pure algorithmic Flesch-Kincaid readability scoring (no LLM required). Returns:
- **score** (0–100): Higher = easier to read
- **grade**: Estimated US school grade level
- **level**: easy (60+), moderate (30–59), advanced (<30)

---

## 41. Dashboard

All user roles now see the same customizable dashboard. The previous role-based dashboards have been replaced.

The `DashboardRouter` component renders `DashboardPM` for all roles. Users who own fewer projects than the full portfolio see a **scope toggle** (My Projects / All Projects). Widget visibility, order, and scope are controlled via the **Customize** dropdown and **drag-and-drop reordering**, persisted server-side (migration 072: `dashboard_preferences` JSON column on `users`) with localStorage as an instant cache. The `useDashboardPreferences` hook handles localStorage-first loading with debounced server sync (500ms).

See [Section 23](#23-dashboard) for full widget and endpoint details.

---

## 42. Multi-Agent Collaboration

### Memory Context for Reasoning
ReasoningEngine generators (scope analysis, budget analysis) now inject historical context into Claude prompts:
- Past reflections from the same agent for the same project
- Cross-agent insights (what other agents found in recent scans)

This is provided by `getMemoryContext(agentId, projectId)` which queries the `agent_memory` table.

### Inter-Agent Query Service
Agents can query other agents' conclusions via `InterAgentQueryService`:
- `getLatestInsight(agentId, projectId)` — specific agent's latest finding
- `getInsightsByProject(projectId)` — all agents' findings for a project

### Scan Result Storage
The scan orchestrator stores each project's aggregate scan results in `agent_memory` (type='project', key='latest_scan', TTL=24h) after processing. Portfolio-level agents can then access per-project findings.

### Insight Assembly
`InsightAssemblyService` combines multiple agents' outputs into a unified health assessment:
- Overall health classification (healthy/warning/critical)
- Per-agent findings with severity levels
- Summary text for narratives

---

## 43. Intelligent Dashboard Narratives

### NarrativeService
Generates plain-language summaries tailored to the user's role:
- **finance_officer** focus: budget utilization, cost variances, financial risks
- **scrum_master** focus: sprint progress, velocity trends, blockers
- **executive** focus: high-level status, strategic risks, portfolio health
- **project_manager** focus: schedule adherence, task completion, immediate risks

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/narratives/project/:projectId` — project-level narrative (role from auth context)
- `GET /api/v1/narratives/portfolio` — portfolio-level summary

### Dashboard Integration
The `AISummaryBanner` component shows a narrative section (when enabled via accessibility preferences) with a refresh button. Falls back to static text when AI is unavailable.

---

## 44. Dashboard & Projects

The Dashboard and Projects pages provide a lean, action-oriented project management experience.

### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

A monitoring cockpit with read-only scope toggle:

- **6 KPI Tiles** — Portfolio Health, Overdue Tasks, Open Risks, At-Risk Projects, Budget Variance, Budget Utilization. Each tile has a colored status dot, semantic color chip, hover lift animation, and click-through to drill-in pages (`/kpi/:type`). Health and Overdue tiles display 7-day trend arrows (green up = improving, red down = declining, gray dash = stable).
- **KPI Drill-In Pages** (`/kpi/:type`) — Clicking any KPI tile opens an enriched drill-in page with:
  - **Summary Cards** — 2–4 stat cards above the table (e.g., Avg Health / Healthy / At Risk / Critical for health; Total Overdue / Avg Days / Most Affected Project / Critical Priority for overdue; Total Elevated / Critical / High / Medium for risks; Over Budget / Avg Overrun / Worst Overrun for budget types).
  - **Trend Badge** — Health and Overdue pages show an "Improving", "Declining", or "Stable" badge next to the title, derived from `trendIndicators`.
  - **Distribution Bar** — Health page shows a horizontal stacked bar (green/amber/red by score bands); Risks page shows critical/high/medium breakdown with color legend.
  - **Health Table Enrichment** — The health drill-in adds Schedule, Budget, and Risk sub-score columns plus a 30-day trend sparkline (SVG polyline, color-coded by last score) for each project.
  - **Sortable Table** — All types retain the existing sortable table with click-through to project detail.
- **Portfolio Intelligence** — `AISummaryBanner` with circular health ring, risk summary chips, budget status, key insights, and AI narrative (when enabled). Full dark mode support.
- **Projects Table** — Sortable by 10 columns (name, health, status, priority, type, progress, budget, spent%, end date, days left). Rows navigate to `/project/:id`.
- **Action Center** — Two-column card: "Today's Priorities" (deadline-driven items from predictions) and "AI Next Best Actions" (proposals to approve with confidence % and risk level badges, critical/high notifications to investigate, at-risk projects to review with health score badges).
- **Issues Created vs Resolved** — Weekly trend chart with scope awareness.
- **3-Column Footer** — Milestones widget, Budget Watch widget, Activity Feed with filter pills (All/Agent/Risk/Budget/Meeting/System), date grouping (Today/Yesterday/Earlier), clickable rows, mark-as-read, and navigation.
- **Customize Dropdown** — Toggle any widget section on/off. "Reset to Default Layout" button restores defaults. Includes opt-in placeholders for Sprint Snapshot, Goals Progress, and Team Workload (disabled by default).
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering** — Hover over any widget to reveal a grip handle; drag to reorder. The `WidgetGrid` component groups consecutive `third`-size widgets (Milestones, Budget Watch, Activity Feed) into 3-column rows. Order is persisted to the server.
- **Server Persistence** — `GET/PUT /api/v1/users/me/dashboard-preferences` stores `enabledWidgets`, `widgetOrder`, and `scope` as JSON. On load, localStorage is used instantly, then overwritten by server data if available.

### Projects (`/projects`)

- **Filter Bar** — Search by name, filter by health band (Healthy/Warning/Critical) and status (Active/Planning/On Hold/Completed).
- **AI Portfolio Insights** — Self-fetching 3-up insight tiles from analytics summary, enriched with 7-day trend context (e.g., "Trending down from last week", "Completion rate is trending up").
- **Project Cards** — Grid layout with left border colored by health band, health pill, status/priority chips, progress meter, and inline action buttons. Clicking a card navigates to `/project/:id`.
- **New Project** — Template picker integration for creating projects from templates.

### Onboarding — Welcome Modal

New users see a **WelcomeModal** on their first login after registration. The modal presents three options:

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Create a Project** | Navigates to `/projects` with the new-project dialog open |
| **Import a Schedule** | Navigates to the bulk import flow |
| **I'll explore on my own** | Dismisses the modal without navigation |

First-login detection uses `sessionStorage` (set once per browser session after registration). Dismissal — by choosing any option or closing the modal — is persisted in `localStorage` so the modal does not reappear on subsequent logins from the same browser.

Component: `src/client/src/components/onboarding/WelcomeModal.tsx`

### Project Readiness Bar

A methodology-aware progress bar displayed above the tabs on the project detail page. It guides new project setup with 5 sequential steps that vary by methodology:

| Waterfall | Agile | Hybrid |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Tasks | Backlog | Tasks |
| Dependencies | Sprint | Sprint |
| Resources | Team | Resources |
| Critical Path | Velocity | Critical Path |
| Simulation | Burndown | Velocity |

Data-driven steps (tasks, dependencies, resources, sprints) auto-detect completion from existing data. Click-driven steps (critical path, simulation, velocity, burndown) mark complete on first click and persist via `localStorage`. The bar can be dismissed per project.

Component: `src/client/src/components/onboarding/ProjectReadinessBar.tsx`
Step configurations: `src/client/src/utils/methodology.ts`

### Empty-State CTA

When a user has **zero projects**, the Projects Table on the dashboard renders a "New Project" button in place of the empty table body. Clicking it links to `/projects`, where the project creation flow can be started. This replaces the blank table that previously appeared for new accounts.

### Navigation

Accessible via the "Plan" section in the sidebar:
- Dashboard → `/dashboard`
- Projects → `/projects`

Old routes (`/dashboard-pm`, `/projects-pm`) redirect to the new paths for backwards compatibility.

### Design System

- **Font**: Plus Jakarta Sans (imported via Google Fonts)
- **Primary palette**: Teal (50–900)
- **Health bands**: ≥75 green, 50–74 amber, <50 red
- **Card radius**: `rounded-xl` (12px)
- **Hover lift**: `hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:shadow-md`
- **KPI values**: 27px / font-weight 800
- **Dark mode**: Full coverage across all PM components

## 45. RAID Management

RAID (Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions) is a structured project control framework that gives project managers a single, auditable register for every threat, action item, live problem, and key decision on a project. The implementation is inspired by enterprise ITSM tooling (BMC Remedy / Helix) and enforces no-delete semantics, global sequential record IDs, and a full activity timeline on every record.

### Framework Overview

Each project has one RAID log containing records of four types:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Risk** | A potential future problem that may or may not materialise |
| **Action** | A task or follow-up that must be completed by a specific owner and due date |
| **Issue** | A problem that has already materialised and is actively impacting the project |
| **Decision** | A formal project decision with rationale, decision maker, and alternatives considered |

### Global Sequential Record IDs

Every RAID record is assigned a globally unique, type-prefixed sequential identifier at creation time:

- Risks: `R-001`, `R-002`, …
- Issues: `I-001`, `I-002`, …
- Actions: `A-001`, `A-002`, …
- Decisions: `D-001`, `D-002`, …

IDs are assigned atomically from a per-project counter and never recycled. A cancelled or reversed record retains its original ID permanently.

### Type-Specific Fields and Status Workflows

#### Risk

Fields: title, description, severity (low / medium / high / critical), probability (low / medium / high), impact, owner, mitigation plan, source (manual / ai_scan / agent / import).

Status workflow:
```
proposed → open → monitoring → mitigating → mitigated → closed
                                                       ↘ cancelled (requires reason)
```

#### Issue

Fields: title, description, severity, category, owner, root cause, impact assessment, workaround, resolution plan, target resolution date, source.

Issues are differentiated from risks — they represent problems that have already materialized. The form shows issue-specific fields (root cause, impact assessment, workaround, resolution plan) instead of risk fields (trigger condition, mitigation plan, response plan). Probability is not shown since the issue has already occurred.

Status workflow:
```
proposed → open → in_progress → resolved → closed
                                          ↘ cancelled (requires reason)
```

#### Action

Fields: title, description, owner, due_date, action_type (follow_up / decision_required / information_only / escalation), source.

Status workflow:
```
proposed → open → in_progress → completed → closed
                                           ↘ cancelled (requires reason)
                                           ↘ deferred
```

#### Decision

Fields: title, description, owner, rationale, decided_by, decision_date, alternatives_considered, source.

Status workflow:
```
proposed → pending_decision → decided → deferred
                                      ↘ reversed (admin only — requires reason)
```

### Triage Workflow

RAID items follow a triage workflow aligned with PMI/PRINCE2 governance best practice. **Any team member** can raise a risk, issue, action, or decision — open identification is encouraged.

- **Non-PM roles** (team_member, qa, tester, devops, ba): items are created with status `proposed` and require PM review before becoming active.
- **PM/admin roles** (admin, project_manager, scrum_master, risk_manager, pmo): items bypass triage and are created directly as `open`.

When a `proposed` item is created, all project managers and owners receive a notification: *"New [Type] requires triage: [Title]"*. The PM reviews the item and either promotes it to `open` (or the appropriate starting status) or cancels it with a reason.

This ensures broad visibility of project threats while keeping the active register curated by accountable roles.

### Cancel and Reverse Semantics

RAID records are never deleted. This preserves the audit trail and prevents gap-filling in the sequential ID sequence.

- **Cancel**: Available on any record in any status except `closed`. Requires a mandatory cancellation reason. Sets status to `cancelled`. Available to all roles that can edit the record type.
- **Reverse**: Available on Decision records only, when status is `decided`. Requires a mandatory reason. Sets status to `reversed`. Restricted to admin users.

### Slide-Out Detail Panel

Clicking any row in the RAID log opens a slide-out panel from the right side of the screen. The panel shows:

- Full record header (ID, type badge, status pill, severity chip)
- All type-specific fields (editable inline for permitted roles)
- **Activity timeline** — a chronological log of every state change and comment, with actor name, timestamp, and change description

### Activity Logging

Every change to a RAID record is automatically logged to the activity timeline:

- Status transitions (e.g., `open → in_progress`, `decided → reversed`)
- Field edits (title, description, owner, due date, rationale, etc.)
- Cancel and reverse actions (with the mandatory reason recorded)
- AI Scan findings imported as new records
- Agent writes via `importFromAgent` or `importFromAIScan`

Users can also add manual comments to any record via the comment box at the bottom of the detail panel. Manual comments appear in the timeline interleaved with auto-logged changes.

### AI Agent Partnership

The RAID log integrates with the platform's AI agent layer in two ways:

**AI Scan** — A project-scoped scan that reads the current schedule, task statuses, overdue items, and budget data to surface new risks and issues. Results are presented as a preview; the user selects which findings to import. Imported records are tagged with `source: ai_scan`.

**Agent writes** — Background agents (e.g., the Risk Agent, Budget Agent) can write directly to the RAID log using the `importFromAgent` pathway. These records are tagged with `source: agent` and appear in the log alongside manually created entries. Agent-written records go through the same activity logging as manual records.

The `suggest-mitigation` MCP tool surfaces historical lessons-learned data to suggest mitigation strategies for open risks, callable by AI assistants operating on behalf of risk managers or project managers.

### Role-Based Permissions

| Role | Create Risk | Create Issue | Create Action | Create Decision | Cancel | Reverse |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|---------|
| `admin` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `project_manager` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| `scrum_master` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

| `executive` | No | No | No | No | No | No |
| `qa` / `tester` / `devops` / `claude_sme` | No | No | No | No | No | No |

Reverse (decision reversal) is restricted to `admin` only regardless of project membership role.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend

- **Runtime**: Node.js 22 with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Fastify (high-performance HTTP server)
- **Database**: MySQL (MariaDB compatible) with connection pool timeouts (`connectTimeout: 5s`, `idleTimeout: 30s`, `queueLimit: 50` — env-configurable via `DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, `DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT`, `DB_QUEUE_LIMIT`)
- **Transaction safety**: Multi-table writes use `databaseService.transaction()` with a `queryOn()` helper for ACID guarantees. Fire-and-forget side effects (audit logs, workflow triggers) run after commit.
- **Validation**: Zod schemas on all API inputs (shared `paginationSchema` for list endpoints)
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude SDK (gated by `AI_ENABLED` env var)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket service for live notifications
- **Email**: Configurable email service for password reset and notifications
- **Repository layer**: `BaseRepository` + entity-specific repositories (`ProjectRepository`, `UserRepository`, `ScheduleRepository`) centralize SQL queries and row mapping. Services delegate data access to repositories and keep business logic (audit logging, policy checks, workflow triggers).
- **Service layer**: Stateless services use module-level singletons to avoid redundant instantiation and preserve in-memory caches (e.g., EmbeddingService). Internal queries include safety `LIMIT 1000` on unbounded SELECTs; public list endpoints use proper pagination with `PaginatedResponse<T>`.
- **Structured metrics**: `MetricsService` collects in-memory request counts, latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99), error rates, AI token usage, and DB query counts. Admin endpoint: `GET /api/v1/metrics`.
- **Request context**: `AsyncLocalStorage`-based request ID propagation through all async operations. Winston logger automatically includes `requestId` in every log entry.
- **AI Budget**: Per-user monthly token budget enforcement via `AIBudgetService`

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React 18
- **Build tool**: Vite
- **State management**: Zustand
- **Server state**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **PWA**: Service worker with offline caching, install prompts, push notifications

## 47. User Support & Admin Troubleshooting

### Support Contact Links

Contextual "Need help?" and "Report this issue" mailto links appear on pages where users are most likely to be stuck:

| Page | Link Text | Pre-filled Context |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Login page** | "Need help? Contact support" | Subject: "Login Help", body includes page URL and timestamp |
| **404 page** | "Need help? Contact support" | Subject: "Help - Page Not Found", body includes attempted URL and timestamp |
| **ErrorBoundary** (full-page crash) | "Report this issue" | Subject includes error message, body includes error details, URL, and timestamp |
| **RouteErrorBoundary** (section crash) | "Report this issue" | Same as ErrorBoundary |

All links use `mailto:support@kpbc.ca`. No backend or database changes required — purely client-side mailto links.

### Admin Users Table

The **Admin > Users** page provides a comprehensive user management table with 12 columns, all sortable by clicking the column header (ascending/descending toggle with arrow indicators):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **User** | Full name, email, and username |
| **Role** | Color-coded role badge (admin, project_manager, executive, pmo, etc.) |
| **Tier** | Subscription tier badge: Trial (gray), Consultant (blue), SME (green), Enterprise (amber) |
| **Organization** | Organization name (multi-tenant), or "none" if unassigned |
| **Signed up** | Account creation date |
| **Login status** | Email/login state badge — Verified (green), Unverified (gray), Pending login (yellow), Expired token (red). Sortable by urgency (expired first). |
| **Last login** | Most recent login timestamp |
| **Projects** | Number of projects created by the user |
| **AI Usage** | Color-coded progress bar showing current month's token consumption vs budget (green <70%, amber 70-90%, red >90%), with used/total token counts |
| **AI Budget** | Per-user budget override (inline-editable) or "tier default" |
| **Subscription** | Subscription status badge (active, trialing, past_due, canceled, none) and current period end date |
| **Status** | Active/Inactive toggle. Sortable. |
| **Actions** | Reset PW button; Unlock button (shown when login token is pending/expired); subscription event history button |

**Filters:** Search by name/email/username/organization. Dropdown filters for Role, Tier, Status (active/inactive), and Subscription Status. Showing count updates in real time.

**AI Usage column:** The backend query JOINs `ai_usage_log` (current month) and computes `ai_tokens_used` per user. The frontend calculates usage percentage against the effective budget (per-user override or tier default) and renders a mini progress bar.

**Organization column:** The backend query LEFT JOINs `organizations` on `users.organization_id` to display the org name.

**Subscription column:** Joined from the `subscriptions` control-plane table. Status badge is color-coded: active (green), trialing (blue), past_due (amber), canceled (red), none (gray).

**API endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/admin/users/:id/clear-login-token` — clears stuck login verification tokens
- `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/:id/budget` — sets or clears per-user AI token budget override
- `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/:id/status` — activates or deactivates a user account
- `POST /api/v1/admin/users/:id/reset-password` — generates a password reset token
- `GET /api/v1/admin/users/:id/subscription-events` — returns the subscription event history for a user (admin only)

## 48. WebSocket Reconnection with Exponential Backoff

The WebSocket connection in `useWebSocket.ts` uses exponential backoff with jitter for automatic reconnection. When the connection drops, it retries with increasing delays (1s base, doubling each attempt, max 30s, +/-30% jitter) up to 20 attempts. A `ConnectionStatus` indicator in the TopBar shows the current state:

- **Connected:** Tiny green dot, auto-fades after 3 seconds
- **Connecting:** Amber pulsing dot with "Reconnecting..." tooltip
- **Disconnected:** Red dot with a clickable "Reconnect" link that resets attempts and triggers immediate reconnection

Exported hooks: `useConnectionState()` returns the current `WsConnectionState` (`'connected' | 'connecting' | 'disconnected'`). `reconnectNow()` forces an immediate reconnect attempt.

---

## 49. Favourite / Pinned Projects

Users can favourite (star) projects for quick access. Favourited projects appear at the top of the Projects page and in a "Pinned" section in the sidebar (up to 5).

### Database

`user_favourite_projects` table with composite PK `(user_id, project_id)` and FK cascade on project delete (migration 058).

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/projects/favourites` | Get user's favourite projects (full objects) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/projects/:id/favourite` | Add project to favourites |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/projects/:id/favourite` | Remove project from favourites |

The `GET /api/v1/projects` response now includes an `isFavourite` boolean flag per project.

### UI

- **Project cards** show a star icon in the header — filled amber when favourited, outline when not. Click toggles the state.
- **Projects page** sorts favourited projects to the top of the grid.
- **Sidebar** shows a "Pinned" section below the main navigation (PM view only) with up to 5 favourite projects as direct links.

### AI Token Usage Indicator

The sidebar displays a real-time **AI Token Usage Indicator** above the user section:

- **Expanded sidebar**: Shows "AI Tokens" label, percentage used, a progress bar, and "{remaining} of {budget} remaining" text.
- **Collapsed sidebar**: Shows a compact SVG ring chart with a lightning bolt icon.
- **Color-coded**: Green (<70% used), amber (70-90%), red (>90%).
- Data is fetched from `GET /api/v1/ai/budget` with a 5-minute stale time (React Query). Only shown to authenticated users.
