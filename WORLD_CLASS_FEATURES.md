# World-Class Features Roadmap

## Vision
An agentic AI project management platform that combines the scheduling power of Primavera P6, the usability of Monday.com/Smartsheet, and autonomous AI agents that no competitor offers. 14 agents continuously detect, reason, and act — with human-in-the-loop governance and full audit trails.

## Benchmarked Against
- Oracle Primavera P6 (enterprise scheduling, EVM, critical path)
- Microsoft Project (Gantt, resource leveling, baselines)
- Monday.com (UX, automation, collaboration)
- Wrike (AI features, resource management)
- Smartsheet (portfolio management, dashboards)
- Asana (workload management, goals)

---

## Priority 1: Table Stakes (Must-Have to Be Taken Seriously)

### 1.1 Critical Path Method (CPM)
- Auto-calculate forward/backward pass (ES, EF, LS, LF)
- Total float and free float per task
- Highlight critical path on Gantt chart (red bars)
- Recalculate on demand via API and UI toggle
- **Benchmark:** Primavera P6, MS Project

### 1.2 Baseline Management
- Save schedule baseline snapshots (planned start, planned end, progress)
- Compare baseline vs actual on Gantt (dual bars)
- Start, end, and duration variance analysis per task
- Multiple baseline support (Baseline 1, 2, 3...)
- Baseline comparison report
- **Benchmark:** Primavera P6, MS Project

### 1.3 Full Earned Value Management (EVM)
- Planned Value (PV / BCWS)
- Earned Value (EV / BCWP)
- Actual Cost (AC / ACWP)
- Cost Performance Index (CPI = EV/AC)
- Schedule Performance Index (SPI = EV/PV)
- Estimate at Completion (EAC)
- Estimate to Complete (ETC)
- To-Complete Performance Index (TCPI)
- Variance at Completion (VAC)
- S-Curve visualization (PV vs EV vs AC over time)
- **Benchmark:** Primavera P6

### 1.4 Gantt Timescale Zoom, Resizable Splitter & Inline Grid Editing
- Five zoom levels: Day (32px/day), Week (10px/day), Month (3.2px/day), Quarter (1.2px/day), Year (0.27px/day)
- Two-tier timescale header (upper tier: coarser unit, lower tier: finer unit)
- Segmented zoom control in toolbar (D | W | M | Q | Y)
- Draggable splitter between task table and timeline (width persists per schedule)
- 11 columns in left panel: #, Task Name, Pred, Start, End, Duration, Est Days, %, Priority, Assigned, Status
- Zoom and splitter width persist per schedule via localStorage
- **Inline grid editing** — click any cell to edit directly in the left panel (10 editable fields: name, predecessor, start, end, duration, est days, %, priority, assigned, status). Tab/Shift+Tab navigates across cells and rows. Duration edits auto-compute end date. Enter saves, Escape cancels, blur auto-saves, green flash confirms success. Input types match field: text, date picker, number, select dropdown, MS Project predecessor notation.
- **Benchmark:** MS Project, Primavera P6 — matches P6/MS Project zoom + dual header + resizable splitter + inline cell editing

### 1.5 Kanban Board View
- Toggle between Gantt / Kanban / Table views
- Columns by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
- Drag-and-drop cards between columns
- Card shows: task name, assignee, priority, due date, progress, subtask count badge, dependency count badge
- **Inline quick-add** per column — create tasks without opening a modal
- **Swimlane mode** — group by Assignee or Priority; persists in localStorage
- **Benchmark:** Monday.com, Jira, Asana — **matches** with swimlanes and inline quick-add

### 1.6 Resource Pool & Workload View

- **Benchmark:** MS Project, Primavera P6

### 2.2 Workflow Automation Builder (DAG Engine)
- Declarative DAG-based workflow engine with DB persistence
- **Natural Language Builder:** "Generate with AI" input — describe automation in plain English, AI returns a structured DAG definition (nodes + edges) for preview and editing before save (`POST /api/v1/workflows/generate`)
- Node types: trigger, condition, action, approval gate, delay, agent
- Triggers: status_change, progress_threshold, date_passed, task_created, priority_change, assignment_change, dependency_change, budget_threshold, project_status_change, manual
- Event-driven: task create/update and project budget/status changes automatically fire matching workflows
- Conditions: field-based evaluation with operators (equals, greater_than, contains, etc.)
- Actions: update_field, log_activity, send_notification (real notifications via NotificationService), invoke_agent
- Agent nodes: invoke registered AI agent capabilities inline with retry logic and backoff
- Approval gates: pause execution until resumed via API/UI
- Multi-step workflows with branching (yes/no edges on conditions)
- Persistent execution history with per-node status tracking
- 15-minute overdue-task scanner triggers date_passed workflows automatically

- **Benchmark:** Monday.com, Wrike, Smartsheet (exceeds with DAG support + approval gates + agent nodes + NL builder)

### 2.3 Custom Dashboards
- Role-based dashboards (PM project list, Executive analytics)
- Executive view: portfolio charts, KPI cards, status summaries
- **On Track percentage** uses actual schedule variance (SPI) and budget variance instead of a progress-threshold heuristic, accurately reflecting project health
- Widget drag-to-reorder: drag handle (grip icon) on hover, blue ring drop indicator, order persisted in localStorage (separate from visibility toggles)
- Auto-refresh via WebSocket cache invalidation
- **Benchmark:** Monday.com, Smartsheet

**Dashboard & Projects**
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — 6 KPI tiles with status dots, 7-day trend arrows, and enriched drill-in pages (summary cards, trend badges, distribution bars, health sparklines + sub-scores). Portfolio Intelligence banner with trend context, Action Center (confidence/risk/health badges on actions), Projects Table, Issues Trend, Milestones, Budget Watch (portfolio summary + burn-rate indicators), Sprint Velocity (delta % + commitment ratio), Activity Feed with filter pills and date grouping. Customizable via widget dropdown (includes opt-in Sprint Snapshot, Goals Progress, Team Workload with overallocation warnings).

- **Benchmark:** Monday.com, Smartsheet

### 2.5 Calendar & Table Views
- **Calendar view** with three display modes: Month (default with drag-to-reschedule), Week (7-column with full task cards), Day (single-day detail view). Toggle via header buttons. Navigation arrows and Today button in all modes. Drag-to-reschedule preserves task duration.
- **Table view** with inline editing (spreadsheet-like)
- MS Project-style column picker: 22 columns across 4 groups (Standard, Scheduling/CPM, Baseline, Other)
- **Row number (#) column** — always visible, sequential numbering, cannot be toggled off
- **Multi-predecessor support** — up to 20 predecessors per task, each with its own type (FS/SS/FF/SF) and lag days, stored in a `task_dependencies` junction table
- **MS Project-style predecessor display** — comma-separated compact row-number notation (e.g. "3FS+2d,5SS,7") instead of full task names; same format used in CSV export
- **Dependency health badges** — colour-coded dots (green/yellow/red) per predecessor showing completion status. No other PM tool shows dependency health inline.
- **Inline predecessor editing** — click and type comma-separated row numbers with optional type and lag; validated with error feedback
- **Task form multi-predecessor UI** — add/remove dependency rows in the task modal, each with predecessor selector, type dropdown, and lag field
- **Server-side dependency validation** — single `validateDependency()` method enforces self-reference, circular, cross-schedule, existence, and 20-predecessor limit checks across API, UI, and AI tools. Orphan cleanup via `ON DELETE CASCADE` on task deletion.
- Column visibility persisted per schedule in localStorage
- CPM columns (Early Start, Late Finish, Total Float, etc.) auto-trigger critical path computation
- Baseline variance columns populate when comparison is active
- WBS auto-computed from task hierarchy

- **Cross-view filter bar** — search by name, filter by status/priority/assignee, CSV export of filtered tasks. Applies to all views (Gantt, Kanban, Calendar, Table).
- **Gantt row action icons** — edit, insert-below, and delete icons on each row (hover to reveal)
- **Mobile schedule view** — view switcher (List/Kanban/Calendar) with swipe-to-complete gesture and tap-to-cycle status on task cards
- **Benchmark:** MS Project, Smartsheet, Monday.com — **exceeds MS Project** with multi-predecessor support, health badges, inline predecessor editing, calendar drag-to-reschedule, and mobile swipe gestures

- Per-project cards with health indicator, progress bar, task completion ratio, and budget utilization bar
- Dashboard / Timeline toggle preserving the original multi-project Gantt view
- Server-side aggregation via `/api/v1/reporting/portfolio` returning `budgetAllocated`, `budgetSpent`, `progressPercentage`, `totalTasks`, `completedTasks` per project
- **Portfolio Analytics** via `/api/v1/reporting/portfolio/analytics`: cross-project CPI/SPI comparison table with SVG sparkline trends (last 8 weeks), burndown trend sparklines per project (ideal vs. actual), and sortable project comparison matrix (health, CPI, SPI, budget %, progress, tasks). Redis-cached (5 min), bounded concurrency (5 projects in parallel), graceful fallbacks for missing data.
- **Benchmark:** Primavera P6, Smartsheet, Monday.com — **exceeds** with EVM-based portfolio analytics (CPI/SPI sparklines, cross-project comparison matrix) alongside budget KPI cards and per-project health cards

### 2.7 Advanced Security
- Role-based access control (13 roles: admin, executive, project_manager, team_member, scrum_master, finance_officer, risk_manager, pmo, ba, qa, tester, devops, claude_sme) with project member roles (owner, manager, editor, viewer)
- MCP tool permission matrix: 83 tools filtered by user role at registration time (agents only see permitted tools)
- Append-only chained audit ledger with API search, filter, and pagination

### 5.8 RAID Management (BMC Remedy/Helix ITSM-Inspired)

A structured project control register for Risks, Actions, Issues, and Decisions — modelled on enterprise ITSM practices from BMC Remedy/Helix and adapted for project management.

**Capabilities:**
- Four record types in a single unified register: Risk, Action, Issue, Decision
- Global sequential type-prefixed IDs (R-001, I-001, A-001, D-001) assigned atomically and never recycled
- Type-specific status workflows with triage entry point: Risk (proposed → open → monitoring → mitigating → mitigated → closed), Issue (proposed → open → in_progress → resolved → closed), Action (proposed → open → in_progress → completed → closed / deferred), Decision (proposed → pending_decision → decided → deferred / reversed)
- **Triage workflow**: any team member can raise RAID items (PMI/PRINCE2 open identification); non-PM roles create items as `proposed` requiring PM review; PM/admin roles bypass triage to `open`; PMs/owners receive notification when items need triage
- Action records carry due_date and action_type (follow_up, decision_required, information_only, escalation)
- Decision records carry rationale, decided_by, decision_date, and alternatives_considered
- No-delete semantics: records are cancelled (with mandatory reason) rather than deleted; cancelled IDs are never reused; decision reversal (admin-only) creates a `reversed` terminal state
- Slide-out detail panel with inline field editing and full activity timeline
- Activity auto-logged on every status transition, field edit, cancel, or reverse; manual comments interleave with auto-logged entries
- Role-based permission matrix: all roles can create RAID items (triage-gated for non-PM roles); admin=all operations including reverse; project_manager/scrum_master/pmo/ba=create + triage + cancel; reverse restricted to admin
- **AI Scan**: project-scoped AI analysis surfaces new Risks and Issues from schedule/task/budget data; user selects which findings to import; imported records tagged `source: ai_scan`
- **Agent partnership**: background agents write directly to RAID log via `importFromAgent`; agent-written records tagged `source: agent`; `suggest-mitigation` MCP tool surfaces historical lessons-learned for open risks
- Stats bar with live counts (Open Risks, Open Issues, Open Actions, Pending Decisions) + severity distribution bar
- Search + collapsible multi-filter toolbar (type, status, severity, source) with active filter count badge
- **Three view modes**: Table (sortable columns, inline status change, bulk select), Board (Kanban drag-and-drop by status), Risk Matrix (5×5 heatmap)
- **Sortable columns** — click any column header (ID, Title, Type, Severity, Status, Owner, Score, Date) to sort asc/desc
- **Inline status change** — click a status badge to pick a new status without opening the detail panel
- **Bulk actions** — checkbox selection with bulk status and severity change
- **Due date warnings** — overdue/due-soon badges on actions and issues with unresolved statuses
- **RAID tab badge** — total open item count shown on the tab header
- **Mobile card layout** — responsive cards on small screens with compact severity/status badges
- **Benchmark:** BMC Remedy/Helix ITSM (no-delete audit semantics, sequential IDs, mandatory cancel reason); exceeds traditional PM tools with AI Scan, risk matrix heatmap, Kanban board, and inline status changes
