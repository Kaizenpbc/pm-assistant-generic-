## I. Strategy & Governance

The rulebook that governs all agent behavior. Must be defined before any agent code is written. Maps directly to PolicyEngine configuration.

### Vision & Objectives
- Define the agent vision and business objectives
- Define what "agentic" means for PM Assistant — the transition from reactive alerts to autonomous decision-making with human oversight

### Autonomy Model
- Define autonomy tiers and progression criteria:
  - **Tier 1: Notify** — detect issues, create notifications, no proposals
  - **Tier 2: Propose** — detect issues, reason about solutions, propose actions, require human approval
  - **Tier 3: Auto-Execute** — detect issues, reason, execute low-risk actions autonomously, notify after the fact
- Define how agents progress from Tier 1 to Tier 3 (proposal acceptance rate, time in service, zero rollbacks)

### Agent Roster
- Define every agent, its domain, its scope, its boundaries
- Define what each agent is responsible for and what it must never touch
- Define agent-to-agent interaction rules:
  - Can agents trigger other agents?
  - Can agents chain or delegate work?
  - What prevents infinite loops?

### Confidence Framework
- Define how confidence scores are calculated (data quality, historical accuracy, model certainty)
- Define what thresholds mean:
  - Below 40%: notify only, never propose
  - 40-60%: propose with explicit "low confidence" warning
  - 60-80%: propose normally
  - Above 80%: eligible for auto-execution (if policy allows)
- Define how confidence is displayed to users

### Risk Classification
- Define the risk matrix — every possible agent action classified:
  - **Low**: read-only queries, generating reports, searching knowledge base
  - **Medium**: modifying task dates, updating progress percentages
  - **High**: reassigning resources, changing task dependencies, modifying schedules
  - **Critical**: modifying budgets, changing project scope, deleting entities, creating change requests
- Map each risk level to default policy enforcement

### Policy Defaults
- Define default policies per risk level:
  - Low risk: `log_only` — agent acts, action is logged
  - Medium risk: `require_approval` — agent proposes, user approves
  - High risk: `require_approval` with manager sign-off
  - Critical risk: `block` by default — must be explicitly enabled per project

### Escalation Protocol
- Define timeout rules: if proposal not reviewed in 24 hours, escalate to project manager
- Define fallback: if project manager doesn't respond in 48 hours, escalate to admin
- Define confidence-based escalation: if agent confidence < 60%, always require approval regardless of risk level
- Define multi-signal escalation: if multiple agents flag the same project, escalate compound risk

### Communication Model
- Define how agents surface findings to users:
  - In-app notifications (always)
  - Email notifications (configurable per user)
  - AI chat panel (conversational interaction with agent reasoning)
  - Dashboard widgets (aggregate view)
- Define notification priority mapping (critical=immediate, high=daily digest, medium=weekly)

### Multi-Tenancy
- Define data isolation rules in agent reasoning context
- Agents must never include data from other users' projects in Claude prompts
- Cross-project intelligence is scoped to a single user's portfolio only
- Define how shared resources across projects are handled

### Concurrency
- Define conflict resolution when agents and humans edit simultaneously:
  - Agent proposals include a version/timestamp of the data they're based on
  - If underlying data changes after proposal is created but before approval, mark proposal as "stale" and re-evaluate
  - Human edits always win over pending agent proposals
  - Two agents cannot modify the same entity in the same scan cycle

### Data Access Rules
- Define per-agent read/write permissions:
  - Schedule Recovery Agent: read tasks/schedules/resources, write task dates and assignments
  - Budget Intelligence Agent: read budgets/costs/EVM, write budget forecasts and change requests
  - Resource Optimization Agent: read resources/assignments/capacity, write resource assignments
  - Cross-Project Intelligence Agent: read-only across portfolio
  - Risk Escalation Agent: read-only, write notifications only
  - Stakeholder Communication Agent: read tasks/schedules/budgets/EVM, write status reports as proposals

### Cost Budget
- Define max Claude API calls per scan cycle
- Define max Claude API calls per project per day
- Define circuit breaker thresholds: if daily spend exceeds $X, pause non-critical agents
- Define token budget per agent invocation (input + output limits)
- Track and report costs per agent, per project, per time period

### Rollback Rules
- Define which actions are reversible (date changes, reassignments) vs. irreversible (sent emails, external integrations)
- Auto-executed actions must be reversible; irreversible actions always require approval
- Define rollback procedure: revert all actions in reverse order, log rollback to audit ledger
- Define partial failure handling: if action 3 of 5 fails, roll back actions 1-2

### Degradation Strategy
- Define behavior when Claude API is down: skip reasoning agents, continue deterministic agents (Monte Carlo, critical path)
- Define behavior when DB is slow: reduce scan scope, skip non-critical agents
- Define behavior when RAG has no data: proceed without knowledge enrichment, lower confidence score
- Define behavior when a specific agent fails repeatedly: circuit breaker, disable after N consecutive failures, alert admin

### Success Metrics
- Proposal acceptance rate (target: >70%)
- Time-to-resolution (time from detection to fix)
- False positive rate (proposals rejected as unnecessary)
- User satisfaction (feedback on proposal quality)
- Cost per insight (Claude spend divided by actionable proposals)
- Mean time between agent-caused incidents

### Testing Strategy
- Define how to validate reasoning quality before shipping
- Golden test cases: known project scenarios with known-good agent responses
- Shadow mode: run new agent version alongside old, compare outputs without executing
- Canary deployment: enable new agent for 1 project first, monitor for 1 week

### Versioning Strategy
- Define how agent versions coexist (registry already supports versioning)
- Define A/B testing: run v1 and v2 simultaneously, compare proposal quality
- Define rollback: if v2 has lower acceptance rate after N proposals, auto-revert to v1
- Define deprecation: v1 disabled after v2 proves stable for 30 days

### Observability Requirements
- Agent execution latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates per agent per day
- Claude token usage per agent per scan
- Proposal lifecycle metrics (created, approved, rejected, expired, executed, rolled back)
- Queue depth (pending proposals per project)
- Dashboard for all of the above

## III. Core Services

New services that form the agentic pipeline. Each is a standalone module in `src/server/services/agents/`.

### ReasoningEngine
`src/server/services/agents/ReasoningEngine.ts`

- Assembles full project context for Claude (tasks, schedule, resources, critical path, historical data, RAG results)
- Builds structured prompts with clear instructions for output format
- Calls claudeService with structured output (JSON mode)
- Parses Claude's response into typed recovery plan / action plan
- Extracts chain-of-thought reasoning for transparency
- Tracks token usage via AgentCostTracker
- Handles Claude API failures gracefully (returns degraded result with lower confidence)

### ActionProposalService
`src/server/services/agents/ActionProposalService.ts`

- Creates proposals from agent reasoning output
- Persists to `agent_proposals` and `agent_proposal_actions`
- Manages proposal lifecycle (pending -> approved/rejected -> executed/rolled_back)
- Links to ApprovalWorkflowService for gating
- Handles proposal expiration (configurable TTL, default 48 hours)
- Marks proposals as "stale" if underlying data changes
- Queries: by project, by status, by agent, by date range

### ActionExecutor
`src/server/services/agents/ActionExecutor.ts`

- Executes approved proposals step by step in `execution_order`
- Each action is atomic: snapshot old state before mutation
- Calls domain services: scheduleService, resourceService, approvalWorkflowService
- Logs every mutation to audit ledger (hash-chained)
- On failure: rolls back all previously executed actions in reverse order
- Updates proposal status throughout (executing -> executed/failed/rolled_back)
- Fires webhooks and notifications on completion

### ConfidenceCalculator
`src/server/services/agents/ConfidenceCalculator.ts`

- Computes confidence scores from multiple factors:
  - **Data quality** (0-100): how complete is the project data? Missing dates, unassigned tasks, stale progress = lower score
  - **Historical accuracy** (0-100): what % of past proposals from this agent were accepted and effective?
  - **Model certainty** (0-100): Claude's self-reported certainty from structured output
- Weighted average produces final confidence score
- Logs scores to `agent_confidence_log` for trend analysis
- Returns factors breakdown for UI display

### AgentCostTracker
`src/server/services/agents/AgentCostTracker.ts`

- Wraps claudeService calls to capture token usage
- Records to `agent_cost_ledger` per invocation
- Enforces budget limits:
  - Per agent per scan cycle
  - Per project per day
  - Global daily limit
- Circuit breaker: if budget exceeded, returns error and skips agent
- Provides aggregation queries for dashboard (daily/weekly/monthly by agent/project)

### AgentFeedbackService
`src/server/services/agents/AgentFeedbackService.ts`

- Records user feedback on executed proposals (effective/ineffective/made worse)
- Captures before/after project health metrics for objective measurement
- Feeds into ConfidenceCalculator's historical accuracy score
- Provides aggregate stats per agent (effectiveness rate, user satisfaction)

### ConflictResolver
`src/server/services/agents/ConflictResolver.ts`

- Detects stale proposals: compares `data_snapshot_version` against current entity state
- When underlying data changes after proposal creation:
  - If minor change: mark proposal as "needs review"
  - If major change (entity deleted, status changed): auto-expire proposal
- Prevents two agents from proposing changes to the same entity in the same scan
- Human edits always invalidate conflicting pending proposals

### DegradationHandler
`src/server/services/agents/DegradationHandler.ts`

- Monitors health of external dependencies (Claude API, database, RAG)
- When Claude API is unavailable:
  - Skip reasoning agents entirely
  - Continue deterministic agents (Monte Carlo, critical path detection)
  - Lower all confidence scores
  - Notify admin
- When database is slow:
  - Reduce scan scope (active projects only, skip planning)
  - Increase scan interval temporarily
- Circuit breaker per agent: disable after N consecutive failures, alert admin
- Provides health status for `/api/v1/agent/health` endpoint

---

## IV. Agent Implementations

Each agent follows the pattern: perceive -> reason -> plan -> propose. Registered in `agentCapabilities.ts`.

### Schedule Recovery Agent
`src/server/services/agents/ScheduleRecoveryAgent.ts`

- **Trigger**: delay detected by existing auto-reschedule scan
- **Perception**: delayed tasks, critical path, resource availability, historical velocity
- **Reasoning**: Claude analyzes root cause, impact on downstream tasks, recovery options
- **Output**: ranked recovery options, each with concrete task/resource changes
- **Registration**: `schedule-recovery-v1`, capability `schedule.recover`
- **Input schema**: `{ scheduleId, delays[], criticalPath, resources[] }`
- **Output schema**: `{ recoveryPlan, proposals[], reasoning, confidence }`
- **Risk level**: high (modifies task dates and assignments)
- **Default policy**: require_approval

### Budget Intelligence Agent
`src/server/services/agents/BudgetIntelligenceAgent.ts`

- **Trigger**: CPI/SPI threshold breach or trending negative
- **Perception**: EVM metrics, cost breakdown by task, resource costs, burn rate history
- **Reasoning**: Claude correlates budget deviation with specific tasks/resources, forecasts scenarios
- **Output**: budget recovery recommendations (reallocation, scope reduction, resource changes)
- **Registration**: `budget-intelligence-v1`, capability `budget.recover`
- **Input schema**: `{ projectId, forecast, evmMetrics, costBreakdown }`
- **Output schema**: `{ analysis, recommendations[], budgetImpact, reasoning, confidence }`
- **Risk level**: critical (involves budget modifications)
- **Default policy**: block (must be explicitly enabled)

### Resource Optimization Agent
`src/server/services/agents/ResourceOptimizationAgent.ts`

- **Trigger**: resource overallocation (>100% utilization), under-utilization (<40%), or bottleneck roles detected
- **Perception**: resource workloads via `resourceService.computeWorkload()` — utilization %, peak utilization, role-based grouping
- **Reasoning**: Claude analyzes workload imbalances, identifies root causes (uneven distribution, skill gaps, staffing shortfalls), proposes rebalancing
- **Output**: resource rebalancing proposal with `reassign_resource`, `create_change_request`, `send_notification` actions
- **Registration**: `resource-optimization-v1`, capability `resource.optimize`
- **Input schema**: `{ projectId, userId, scanId? }`
- **Output schema**: `{ analysis, proposal, indicators, skipped, skipReason? }`
- **Guard chain**: cost budget → kill switch → rate limiter → circuit breaker → detect indicators → reason → propose
- **Risk level**: high (resource reassignment actions)
- **Default policy**: require_approval

### Cross-Project Intelligence Agent
`src/server/services/agents/CrossProjectIntelligenceAgent.ts`

- **Trigger**: runs once per scan cycle after all per-project agents complete
- **Perception**: health snapshots across all active/planning projects — health scores, EVM metrics (CPI/SPI), overdue tasks, resource allocation, budget utilization
- **Reasoning**: Claude identifies cross-project patterns (common root causes, resource contention, cascading delays, portfolio risk distribution)
- **Output**: strategic insights, warnings, and recommendations with `send_notification` and `create_change_request` actions
- **Registration**: `cross-project-intelligence-v1`, capability `portfolio.analyze`
- **Input schema**: `{ userId, scanId? }`
- **Output schema**: `{ analysis, proposal, indicators, skipped, skipReason? }`
- **Guard chain**: cost budget → kill switch → rate limiter → circuit breaker → gather indicators → reason → propose
- **Significance thresholds**: requires ≥2 active projects; triggers when ≥2 at-risk, ≥2 budget deficit, ≥1 resource bottleneck, or ≥1 common risk
- **Risk level**: low (read-only analysis, notification only)
- **Default policy**: log_only

### Risk Escalation Agent
`src/server/services/agents/RiskEscalationAgent.ts`

- **Trigger**: runs last in each scan cycle after all per-project and portfolio agents complete
- **Perception**: per-project agent flags accumulated during the scan (schedule delay, budget overrun, scope creep, resource bottleneck, meeting overdue)
- **Reasoning**: Claude identifies compound risks where multiple risk factors converge on the same project, assesses cascading effects, and determines escalation urgency
- **Output**: escalation proposals with `send_notification` and `create_change_request` actions
- **Registration**: `risk-escalation-v1`, capability `risk.escalate`
- **Input schema**: `{ userId, projectResults[{ projectId, projectName, agentFlags, details }], scanId? }`
- **Output schema**: `{ analysis, proposal, indicators, skipped, skipReason? }`
- **Guard chain**: cost budget → kill switch → rate limiter → circuit breaker → gather indicators → reason → propose
- **Compound threshold**: project must be flagged by ≥2 agents to be considered a compound risk
- **Risk level**: low-to-high (creates notifications and change requests for compound risks)
- **Default policy**: log_only

### Stakeholder Communication Agent
`src/server/services/agents/StakeholderCommunicationAgent.ts`

- **Trigger**: runs per-project during each scan cycle (after resource optimization agent)
- **Perception**: gathers comprehensive project status snapshot — completion rate, EVM metrics (CPI/SPI), upcoming milestones (14 days), recently completed tasks (7 days), risk indicators (overdue, budget, schedule)
- **Reasoning**: Claude generates stakeholder-ready status report with executive summary, key highlights, risks/concerns, upcoming milestones, and recommended actions
- **Output**: status report proposal with `send_notification` action containing the full report
- **Registration**: `stakeholder-communication-v1`, capability `stakeholder.report`
- **Input schema**: `{ projectId, userId, scanId? }`
- **Output schema**: `{ analysis, proposal, snapshot, skipped, skipReason? }`
- **Guard chain**: cost budget → kill switch → rate limiter → circuit breaker → gather snapshot → reason → propose
- **Skips when**: no tasks in project, reasoning engine unavailable, snapshot gathering fails
- **Risk level**: low (informational report, no data mutations)
- **Default policy**: require_approval

  Condition: confidence_score >= 60
  Enforcement: log_only

Policy: agent-medium-risk-approval
  Action Pattern: agent.invoke.schedule.*
  Condition: confidence_score >= 40
  Enforcement: require_approval

Policy: agent-high-risk-approval
  Action Pattern: agent.invoke.resource.*
  Condition: confidence_score >= 40
  Enforcement: require_approval

Policy: agent-critical-risk-block
  Action Pattern: agent.invoke.budget.*
  Condition: always

  Condition: confidence_score < 40
  Enforcement: block

Policy: agent-cost-circuit-breaker
  Action Pattern: agent.invoke.*
  Condition: daily_cost_usd > 10
  Enforcement: block
```

### Approval Chain Configuration
- Low risk: no approval needed
- Medium risk: project owner approval
- High risk: project owner + manager approval
- Critical risk: admin approval required

### Migration
- Create migration `NNN_seed_agent_policies.sql` to insert default policies
- Policies can be modified per project via the policy management API

- Verify all database state at each stage

**Policy gate test** (`src/server/__tests__/integration/agentPolicy.test.ts`)
- Agent proposes action, policy blocks it, verify proposal is created with blocked status
- Agent proposes action, policy requires approval, verify approval flow
- Agent proposes action, policy allows, verify auto-execution

### Regression Tests

**Golden test cases** (`src/server/__tests__/agents/golden/`)
- Known project scenarios with known-good agent responses
- Run against new agent versions to detect reasoning quality regressions
- Stored as JSON fixtures with input context + expected output shape

### Load Tests

**Scan cycle performance** (`src/server/__tests__/load/agentScan.test.ts`)
- Measure time for full portfolio scan with 10, 50, 100 projects
- Verify scan completes within acceptable time (target: <5 min for 100 projects)
- Verify memory usage stays within LVE limits (2GB RAM)

## IX. Observability & Monitoring

### Health Endpoint
`GET /api/v1/agent/health` returns:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy | degraded | unhealthy",
  "agents": {
    "schedule-recovery-v1": {
      "lastRun": "2026-06-28T02:00:00Z",
      "lastDurationMs": 4500,
      "errorRate24h": 0.02,
      "circuitBreaker": "closed",
      "proposalsCreated24h": 3,
      "proposalsApproved24h": 2
    }
  },
  "costs": {
    "today": { "tokens": 45000, "estimatedUsd": 1.35 },
    "budgetRemaining": 8.65
  },
  "pendingProposals": 5,
  "claudeApiStatus": "available"
}
```

### Metrics to Track
- Agent execution latency: p50, p95, p99 per agent
- Error rates: per agent per day, with error type breakdown
- Claude token usage: per agent, per project, per scan cycle
- Proposal lifecycle:
  - Created per day/week
  - Time to review (pending -> approved/rejected)
  - Acceptance rate (approved / (approved + rejected))
  - Execution success rate
  - Rollback rate
  - Expiration rate
- Confidence score distribution per agent
- Feedback scores (effective / partially effective / ineffective / made worse)

### Alerts
- Agent failure rate > 20% in 1 hour -> notify admin
- Cost budget > 80% consumed -> notify admin
- Proposal acceptance rate < 50% over 7 days -> review agent reasoning
- Circuit breaker opened -> notify admin
- No scan completed in 48 hours -> notify admin

### Dashboard
- Real-time agent status (AgentDashboard component)
- Historical trends (acceptance rate, cost, latency over time)
- Per-project agent activity drill-down

## Implementation Order

```
1. AGENT_STRATEGY.md (strategy, policy, governance sections)    -- defines the rules
2. Database migrations (6 new tables)                           -- persistence layer
3. Core services (8 services)                                   -- agentic pipeline
4. Schedule Recovery Agent (first agent)                        -- prove the pattern
5. Policy seed migration                                        -- default guardrails
6. API routes (proposals, feedback, costs, health)              -- expose to frontend
7. Frontend (proposals panel, detail view, dashboard)           -- user interaction
8. Tests (unit, integration, golden, load)                      -- quality gates
9. Observability (health endpoint, metrics, alerts)             -- operational visibility
10. Documentation updates                                       -- ship with code
11. Budget Intelligence Agent (second agent)                    -- expand coverage
12. Resource Optimization Agent (third agent)                   -- cross-project
13. Cross-Project Intelligence Agent (fourth agent)             -- portfolio level
14. Risk Escalation Agent (fifth agent)                         -- compound risks
15. Stakeholder Communication Agent (sixth agent)               -- status reports
16. Project Hygiene Agent (seventh agent)                        -- data quality
17. Dependency Risk Agent (eighth agent)                         -- blocked chains
18. Lessons Learned Agent (ninth agent)                          -- auto-extract
19. Predictive Alerting Agent (tenth agent)                      -- early warnings
20. Autonomous Execution (Tier 3)                                -- auto-execute
```

Each step is a commit-and-push cycle. Each agent follows the same pattern: register capability, wire into scheduler, test, document.
